The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated through methylene blue degradation under visible light irradiation. Compared to Bi₂O₂CO₃, flower-like Ag@AgBr/Bi₂O₂CO₃ micro-composites show enhanced photocatalytic activities. In addition, results indicate that both the physicochemical properties and associated photocatalytic activities of Ag@AgBr/Bi₂O₂CO₃ composites are shown to be dependent on the loading quantity of Ag@AgBr. The highest photocatalytic performance was achieved at 7 wt % Ag@AgBr, degrading 95.18% methylene blue (MB) after 20 min of irradiation, which is over 1.52 and 3.56 times more efficient than that of pure Ag@AgBr and pure Bi₂O₂CO₃, respectively. Bisphenol A (BPA) was also degraded to further demonstrate the degradation ability of Ag@AgBr/Bi₂O₂CO₃. A photocatalytic mechanism for the degradation of organic compounds over Ag@AgBr/Bi₂O₂CO₃ was proposed. Results from this study illustrate an entirely new approach to fabricate semiconductor composites containing Ag@AgX/bismuth (X = a halogen)."

After optimization of microextraction conditions (15 mL sample volume, extraction time of 40 min, extraction temperature of 30 ± 1°C, 300 μL acetonitrile as the desorption solvent, and desorption time of 7 min), the fiber was used to extract BPA from packed mineral water, followed by HPLC-UV on an XDB-C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm id, 3.5 μm particle) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (45 + 55%, v/v) and flow rate of 1 mL . min-1). A low LOD (0.20 μg . L-1) and good linearity (0.9977) in the calibration graph indicated that the proposed method was suitable for the determination of BPA."
1,1,2017,"L Du, W Sun, X M Li, X Y Li, W Liu, D Chen",DNA methylation and copy number variation analyses of human embryonic stem cell-derived neuroprogenitors after low-dose decabromodiphenyl ether and/or bisphenol A exposure.,Human & experimental toxicology,"The polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and bisphenol A (BPA) are environmental contaminants that can cross the placenta and exert toxicity in the developing fetal nervous system. Copy number variants (CNVs) play a role in a number of genetic disorders and may be implicated in BDE-209/BPA teratogenicity. In this study, we found that BDE-209 and/or BPA exposure decreased neural differentiation efficiency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), although there was a >90% induction of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) from exposed hESCs. However, the mean of CNV numbers in the NPCs with BDE-209 + BPA treatment was significantly higher compared to the other groups, whereas DNA methylation was lower and DNA methyltransferase(DNMT1 and DNMT3A) expression were significantly decreased in all of the BDE-209 and/or BPA treatment groups compared with the control groups. The number of CNVs in chromosomes 3, 4, 11, 22, and X in NPCs with BDE-209 and/or BPA exposure was higher compared to the control group. In addition, CNVs in chromosomes 7, 8, 14, and 16 were stable in hESCs and hESCs-derived NPCs irrespective of BDE-209/BPA exposure, and CNVs in chromosomes 20 q11.21 and 16 p13.11 might be induced by neural differentiation. Thus, BDE-209/BPA exposure emerges as a potential source of CNVs distinct from neural differentiation by itself. BDE-209 and/or BPA exposure may cause genomic instability in cultured stem cells via reduced activity of DNA methyltransferase, suggesting a new mechanism of human embryonic neurodevelopmental toxicity caused by this class of environmental toxins."
1,1,2017,"La-Or Chailurkit, Pechngam Tengpraettanakorn, Suwannee Chanprasertyotin, Boonsong Ongphiphadhanakul",Is bisphenol A exposure associated with the development of glucose intolerance and increased insulin resistance in Thais?,Nutrition and health,"Bisphenol A (BPA), the monomeric component of polycarbonate plastics, reportedly possesses endocrine-disrupting effects. Exposure to low levels of BPA during more vulnerable periods leads to abnormalities related to sexual development in experimental animals. Moreover, recently a few epidemiological studies in Caucasians have demonstrated the association of BPA exposure with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in the present study we examined the association of BPA exposure and abnormal glucose tolerance in Thais. This is a cross-sectional study of 240 participants aged at least 50 years, randomly selected by computer-generated random numbers within each glucose tolerance status from an oral glucose tolerance study of 661 participants. There were 80 participants in each group of type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Serum BPA was measured by competitive ELISA. The detection rate of BPA was significantly higher in participants with IGT compared to those with NGT ( p < 0.05), while no difference was found between participants with type 2 diabetes and NGT. When participants with type 2 diabetes were stratified into those with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) under the diabetic threshold (<126 mg/dL) and those over (≥126 mg/dL), it was found that those with FPG under the diabetic threshold had measurable rates of BPA comparable to those with IGT, and rates significantly higher than the NGT group ( p < 0.05), while those with FPG over the diabetic threshold did not have higher rates of measurable BPA compared with the NGT group. In conclusion, BPA exposure is not uncommon in Thais. There is an association between BPA exposure and IGT, but not type 2 diabetes."

The existence and contribution of both TiO₂ and g-C₃N₄/HT-g-C₃N₄ in the composite was confirmed through various analytical techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis-DRS), and photoluminescence (PL) analysis. The results showed that the titania in the binary composite exhibited both pure rutile and anatase phases. The morphological analysis indicated that the spongy ""morel-like"" structure of g-C₃N₄ turned to nanotube form after alkaline hydrothermal treatment and thereby decreased the specific surface area of HT-g-C₃N₄. The low surface area of HT-g-C₃N₄ dominates its promising optical property and effective charge transfer, resulting in a deprived degradation efficiency of BPA two times lower than pure g-C₃N₄. The binary composite of HT-g-C₃N₄/TiO₂ exhibited excellent degradation efficiency of BPA with 2.16 times higher than the pure HT-g-C₃N₄. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the promising optical band gap structure with heterojunction interface, favorable specific surface area, and good charge separation."
1,5,2017,"Jennifer A Honeycutt, Jenny Q T Nguyen, Amanda C Kentner, Heather C Brenhouse",Effects of Water Bottle Materials and Filtration on Bisphenol A Content in Laboratory Animal Drinking Water.,Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used in the polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins that are found in laboratory animal husbandry materials including cages and water bottles. Concerns about BPA exposure in humans has led to investigations that suggest physiologic health risks including disruptions to the endocrine system and CNS. However, the extent of exposure of laboratory animals to BPA in drinking water is unclear. In the first study, we compared the amount of BPA contamination in water stored in plastic bottles used in research settings with that in glass bottles. The amount of BPA that leached into water was measured across several time points ranging from 24 to 96 h by using a BPA ELISA assay. The results showed that considerable amounts of BPA (approximately 0.15 μg/L) leached from polycarbonate bottles within the first 24 h of storage. In the second study, BPA levels were measured directly from water taken from filtered compared with unfiltered taps. We observed significantly higher BPA levels in water from unfiltered taps (approximately 0.40 μg/L) compared with taps with filtration systems (approximately 0.04 μg/L). Taken together, our findings indicate that the use of different types of water bottles and water sources, combined with the use of different laboratory products (food, caging systems) between laboratories, likely contribute to decreased rigor and reproducibility in research. We suggest that researchers consider reporting the types of water bottles used and that animal care facilities educate staff regarding the importance of flushing nonfiltered water taps when filling animal water bottles."
17,5,2017,"Agostino Di Ciaula, Piero Portincasa",Diet and contaminants: driving the rise to obesity epidemics?,Current medicinal chemistry,"The obesity epidemic is spreading worldwide without reversal trend and despite specific policies oriented to dietary habits and lifestyle, which seem to have modest effects. Genetic factors only partly explain the rise, whereas environmental factors seem to play a key role, mainly by gene-environment interactions through epigenetic mechanisms. A number of animal and human studies point to maternal diet, intestinal microbiota and chemicals introduced as contaminants with food, all factors able to increase the risk of obesity. Widely diffused toxics (mainly BPA, phthalates, pesticides) are able to promote obesity in children and adults, mainly by acting on the differentiation pathway linking multipotent stromal stem cell to mature adipocyte, modulating epigenetic factors and influencing a series of mechanisms finally leading to altered dietary habits, increased adipocyte formation and fat storage. Furthermore, the adipose tissue is an important target for several chemicals (mainly POPs) which represent a threat to metabolic health. In conclusion, besides excessive individual energy intake and inadequate lifestyle, other broadly diffused and modifiable factors (mainly ingestion of toxic chemicals with food) seem to have a critical role in the rapid epidemiological growing of obesity, also considering trans-generational transmission of risk and later development of obesity due to exposure during early life. Further studies are needed, to better assess interactions between cumulative effects of toxic food contaminants and modification of diet and lifestyle, and to verify the efficacy of primary prevention strategies acting on all these factors and potentially able to reverse the continuous rising of the obesity epidemic."

In humans, prenatal BPA exposure is associated with sex-specific behavioural problems in children, and HPA axis dysregulation may be a biological mechanism. The objective of the current study was to examine sex differences in associations between prenatal maternal urinary BPA concentration and HPA axis function in 3 month old infants."
25,5,2017,"Y M Wong, R Li, C K F Lee, H T Wan, Chris K C Wong","The measurement of bisphenol A and its analogues, perfluorinated compounds in twenty species of freshwater and marine fishes, a time-trend comparison and human health based assessment.",Marine pollution bulletin,"Our previous study in 2011 reported the detection of BPA and PFAAs in 20 species of marine and freshwater fishes. With an emerging evidence to suggest the metabolic-disrupting effects of BPA/PFAAs in animals, the present study was aimed to provide a time-trend analysis to determine the current concentrations of PFAAs and BPA in 20 commercially available Hong Kong species of fishes. Since the manufacture and use of BPA is being prohibited in most nations, the introduction of BPA alternatives has recently been incorporated in the markets. Therefore, the concentrations of BPB, BPF and BPS were determined. In the present study, all freshwater and seawater fish samples showed quantified concentrations [>Limit of Quantification (LOQ<0.5ng/g)] of BPA. BPF was detected in some marine (yellow seafin, bigeye, goldspotted rabbitfish, snubnose pompano, tongue sole, Bleeker's grouper and orange-spotted grouper) and freshwater fishes (mud carp, crucian carp, tilapia, catfish, mandarin fish, grass carp, grey mullet and spotted snakehead). Two of the compounds, BPS and BPB could only be identified in the marine fishes (snubnose pompano, yellow seafin). In PFAA analysis, PFOA, PFDA, PFOS, PFUdA and PFDoA were found in most of the marine and freshwater fishes. PFOS and PFOA were shown to be the two predominant PFAAs in fishes. On the basis of the measured concentrations of bisphenols, BPs (BPA, BPB, BPF, BPS) and PFAAs, the average daily intake for BPs (20.5-31.5ng/kgb.w./day) and PFAAs (1.17-1.83ng/kgb.w./day) were calculated and found to be lower than values of tolerable daily intake (TDI) established in Europe. However, as compared with our previous study in 2011, the present study revealed an approximate 10-fold increase in the concentrations of BPA in the fish samples. Although the hazard ratio of consuming fishes for BPA and PFAA exposure is expected to remain low, possible additive metabolic-disrupting effect of BPA and its analogues as well PFAAs should be taken into consideration for human health risk assessment."

This study investigated the removal efficiencies of 23 known or suspected EDCs through the San Marcos WRRF to determine which treatment process was the most effective at removal. Results from samples collected at the hospital indicate that the hospital discharge is contributing to the concentration of these compounds in the San Marcos wastewater collection system (0.05-140 µg/L concentrations). The most frequently detected compounds in the WRRF influent included acetaminophen, nonylphenol, caffeine, benzophenone, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan. Comparison of influent and effluent concentrations showed that the San Marcos WRRF is effectively removing (>92%) these compounds, with the exception of carbamazepine and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). These preliminary results will be used to guide future improvements within the WRRF."
1,6,2017,"Wannisa Sukjee, Chompoonuch Tancharoen, Pa-Thai Yenchitsomanus, M Paul Gleeson, Chak Sangma",Small-Molecule Dengue Virus Co-imprinting and Its Application as an Electrochemical Sensor.,ChemistryOpen,"Polymers can be synthesized to recognize small molecules. This is achieved by introducing the target molecule during monomer self-assembly, where they can be incorporated during cross-linking polymerization. Following additional pre-processing, the material obtained can then be applied as a sensing layer for these molecules in many applications. The sensitivity of the polymers depends on the ""active sites"" imprinted on the surface. Increasing the number of active sites on the polymers surface can be achieved by using nanoparticles as a platform to support and concentrate the molecules for imprinting. In this work, we report the first use of dengue virus as a supporting nanoparticle to make for a more effective polymer composite sensor for the detection of bisphenol A (BPA), which is an environmental contaminant. The dengue virus has a nanoparticle size of around 100 nm and its surface provides regions where lipids and hydrophobic compounds can bind, making it an ideal support. The mixing of BPA with dengue prior to monomer self-assembly led to imprinted polymer surfaces with much higher density BPA binding sites and a limit of detection of 0.1 pm. We demonstrate that a BPA-dengue co-imprinting polymer composite sensor shows a very high sensitivity for BPA, but with lower production costs and technical requirements than other comparable methods."
1,6,2017,"Meghan R Bernier, Laura N Vandenberg",Handling of thermal paper: Implications for dermal exposure to bisphenol A and its alternatives.,PloS one,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting chemical used in a wide range of consumer products including photoactive dyes used in thermal paper. Recent studies have shown that dermal absorption of BPA can occur when handling these papers. Yet, regulatory agencies have largely dismissed thermal paper as a major source of BPA exposure. Exposure estimates provided by agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are based on assumptions about how humans interact with this material, stating that 'typical' exposures for adults involve only one handling per day for short periods of time (<1 minute), with limited exposure surfaces (three fingertips). The objective of this study was to determine how individuals handle thermal paper in one common setting: a cafeteria providing short-order meals. We observed thermal paper handling in a college-aged population (n = 698 subjects) at the University of Massachusetts' dining facility. We find that in this setting, individuals handle receipts for an average of 11.5 min, that >30% of individuals hold thermal paper with more than three fingertips, and >60% allow the paper to touch their palm. Only 11% of the participants we observed were consistent with the EFSA model for time of contact and dermal surface area. Mathematical modeling based on handling times we measured and previously published transfer coefficients, concentrations of BPA in paper, and absorption factors indicate the most conservative estimated intake from handling thermal paper in this population is 51.1 ng/kg/day, similar to EFSA's estimates of 59 ng/kg/day from dermal exposures. Less conservative estimates, using published data on concentrations in thermal paper and transfer rates to skin, indicate that exposures are likely significantly higher. Based on our observational data, we propose that the current models for estimating dermal BPA exposures are not consistent with normal human behavior and should be reevaluated."

The kinetics of BPA removal were systematically evaluated by changing operational parameters, such as US frequency and power, mechanical stirring speed, and temperature, but also comparison of single and coupled systems under the optimum US conditions (35 kHz, 50 W, 300 rpm stirring speed, and 20 °C). The combination of US/UV/P25 exhibited the highest BPA removal rate (28.0 × 10(-3) min(-1)). In terms of the synergy index, the synergistic effect of sonophotocatalysis was found to be 2.2. This indicated that sonophotocatalysis has a considerably higher removal efficiency than sonocatalysis or photocatalysis. The removal of BPA was further investigated to identify BPA byproducts and intermediates using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Five main intermediates were formed during sonophotocatalytic degradation, and complete removal of BPA and its intermediates was obtained after 3 h of operation. The degradation pathway of BPA by sonophotocatalysis was also elucidated."
5,6,2017,"Huajun Zheng, Xiaoyu Zhou, De-Kun Li, Fen Yang, Hongjie Pan, Tianqi Li, Maohua Miao, Runsheng Li, Wei Yuan",Genome-wide alteration in DNA hydroxymethylation in the sperm from bisphenol A-exposed men.,PloS one,"Environmental BPA exposure has been shown to impact human sperm concentration and motility, as well as rodent spermatogenesis. However, it is unclear whether BPA exposure is associated with alteration in DNA hydroxymethylation, a marker for epigenetic modification, in human sperm. A genome-wide DNA hydroxymethylation study was performed using sperm samples of men who were occupationally exposed to BPA. Compared with controls who had no occupational BPA exposure, the total levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) increased significantly (19.37% increase) in BPA-exposed men, with 72.69% of genome regions harboring 5hmc. A total of 9,610 differential 5hmc regions (DhMRs) were revealed in BPA-exposed men relative to controls, which were mainly located in intergenic and intron regions. These DhMRs were composed of 8,670 hyper-hMRs and 940 hypo-hMRs, affecting 2,008 genes and the repetitive elements. The hyper-hMRs affected genes were enriched in pathways associated with nervous system, development, cardiovascular diseases and signal transduction. Additionally, enrichment of 5hmc was observed in the promoters of eight maternally expressed imprinted genes in BPA-exposed sperm. Some of the BPA-affected genes, for example, MLH1, CHD2, SPATA12 and SPATA20 might participate in the response to DNA damage in germ cells caused by BPA. Our analysis showed that enrichment of 5hmc both in promoters and gene bodies is higher in the genes whose expression has been detected in human sperm than those whose expression is absent. Importantly, we observed that BPA exposure affected the 5hmc level in 11.4% of these genes expressed in sperm, and in 6.85% of the sperm genome. Finally, we also observed that BPA exposure tends to change the 5hmc enrichment in the genes which was previously reported to be distributed with the trimethylated Histone 3 (H3K27me3, H3K4me2 or H3K4me3) in sperm. Thus, these results suggest that BPA exposure likely interferes with gene expression via affecting DNA hydroxymethylation in a way partially dependent on trimethylation of H3 in human spermatogenesis. Our current study reveals a new mechanism by which BPA exposure reduces human sperm quality."

Methods: The proliferation of Gastric B-CPAP cell line was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Apoptosis and ROS expression in B-CPAP cells were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in B-CPAP cells were measured by individual assay kits. The expressions of Bcl-2 and γ-HA2X were detected by Western blot. SPSS 18.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: B-CPAP cell activity was promoted by treatment with 3×10(-7)mol/L BPA for 48 h, with significant difference in absorbance between BPA and control groups (1.089±0.053 vs 0.935±0.010, P<0.05). The cell activities of BPA+ ICA(25), BPA+ ICA(50), BPA+ ICA(100) and BPA+ ICA(200) groups was 0.780±0.036, 1.007±0.050, 0.958±0.033 and 0.625±0.064, respectively (all P<0.01). The proliferation of B-CPAP cells treated with BPA for 72 hours showed a similar trend to 48 hours. There was no significant difference between all treatment groups in 24 hours. The apoptosis rate was (19.272±0.186)% in BPA-treated cells, and was (22.412±0.238)% in control cells (P<0.05). The apoptosis rates of BPA+ ICA(50) and BPA+ ICA(200) groups were (23.688±0.412)% and (30.270±0.696)%, respectively (P<0.01). The intracellular accumulation of ROS in BPA, BPA+ ICA(50), and BPA+ ICA(200) groups were 806±21, 1 772±37, 2 041±16, respectively (P<0.01). The expressions of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in control, BPA, BPA+ ICA(50), BPA+ ICA(200) groups were 7 120±151, 9 801±286, 5 902±171 and 4 203±216, respectively (P<0.01). Conclusion: BPA can promote the proliferation of thyroid carcinoma B-CPAP cells and decrease the apoptosis of cells, and this effect can be inhibited by ICA. The possible mechanism is to induce high expression of intracellular ROS and inhibit the expression of antioxidase system, leading to cell oxidative damage, thereby inducing apoptosis."

Due to mounting evidence of these health effects, BPA is being phased out and replaced by other bisphenol variants in ""BPA-free"" products. We have compared estrogenic activity of BPA to 6 bisphenol analogues (bisphenol S, BPS; bisphenol F, BPF; bisphenol AP, BPAP; bisphenol AF, BPAF; bisphenol Z, BPZ; bisphenol B, BPB) in three human breast cancer cell lines. Estrogenicity was assessed (10-11M to 10-4M) by cell growth in an estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated cell proliferation assay, and by the induction of estrogen response element-mediated transcription in a luciferase assay. BPAF was the most potent bisphenol, followed by BPB > BPZ ∼ BPA > BPF ∼ BPAP > BPS. The addition of ICI 182,780 antagonized the activation of ERs. Data mining of ToxCast high-throughput screening assays confirms our results but also shows divergence in the sensitivities of the assays. Gene expression profiles were determined in MCF-7 cells by microarray analysis. The comparison of transcriptome profile alterations resulting from BPA alternatives with an ERα gene expression biomarker further indicates that all BPA alternatives act as ERα agonists in MCF-7 cells. These results were confirmed by Illumina-based RNA sequencing. In conclusion, BPA alternatives are not necessarily less estrogenic than BPA in human breast cancer cells. BPAF, BPB, and BPZ were more estrogenic than BPA. These findings point to the importance of better understanding the risk of adverse effects from exposure to BPA alternatives, including hormone-dependent breast cancer."

All patients underwent a comprehensive diagnostic work-up including right heart catheterisation at baseline and 24 weeks after their last intervention.BPA resulted in improvements in WHO functional class, 6 min walk distance (mean change, +33 m), right ventricular function and haemodynamics, including a decline in mean pulmonary artery pressure by 18% and in pulmonary vascular resistance by 26%. Procedure-related adverse events occurred in 9.4% of the interventions. The most common complications were related to pulmonary vascular injury and consecutive pulmonary bleeding. Most of these events were asymptomatic and self-limiting, but one patient died from pulmonary bleeding, resulting in a mortality rate of 1.8%.BPA resulted in haemodynamic and clinical improvements but was also associated with a considerable number of complications, including one fatal pulmonary bleeding. As the effects of BPA on survival are unknown, randomised controlled outcome trials comparing BPA with approved medical therapies in patients with inoperable CTEPH are required to allow for appropriate risk-benefit assessments."

Owing to the increasing number of alarming reports on the negative consequences of the presence of BPA in human surroundings, more and more studies are being undertaken to clarify the negative effects of BPA on human reproductive processes. The aim of this work was to collect and summarize data on the influence of BPA exposure on reproductive health. Based on an analysis of selected publications it was stated that there is strong proof confirming that BPA is an ovarian, uterine and prostate toxicant at a level below the lowest observed adverse effect level (50 mg kg(-1) bodyweight) as well as a level below the proposed safe level (4 μg kg(-1) bodyweight). It seems there is also reliable evidence in relation to the negative effect of BPA on sperm quality and motility. Limited evidence also pertains to the case of the potential of BPA to affect polycystic ovary syndrome occurrence. Although in epidemiological studies this disease was common, in studies on animal models such results were still not confirmed. No unambiguous results of epidemiological studies and with animal models were obtained in relation to the evaluation of associations between BPA and implantation failure in women, evaluation of associations between BPA and sexual dysfunction in men, and impact of BPA on birth rate, birth weight and length of gestation.

However, very limited data are currently available on the relationship between estrogenic activity and the structure of BP analogs. Therefore, we systematically investigated the estrogenic potency of 14 selected BP analogs with typical structures using experimental and computational methods. Most of the tested BP analogs exhibited weak estrogenic activities in both cell proliferation and MVLN assays with the exception of TBBPA, TCBPA and TBBPS. Molecular modeling techniques have been performed to investigate the dynamic structural characteristics of recognition processes between BPs and estrogen receptor α (ERα) at the atomic level. Thr347 was identified as the key residue responsible for the recognition of TBBPA, TCBPA and TBBPS by means of induced-fit H-bonding interactions in the binding pocket of ERα, whereas other BPs, in turn, rely on the alternative formation of H-bonds with His524. Subsequent allosteric modulation interferes significantly with the stability of helix 12 that is crucial for the transcriptional activity of ERα. These structural perturbations that are induced by the three compounds were further confirmed to reduce the recruitment potency of co-activators more than other BPs based on calculations of binding free energies, which is in line with observed experimental transcriptional activities. Our findings may help to elucidate the estrogenic potency of BPs with different molecular structures."

Mathematical models were applied to describe the degradation mechanism of selected microconstituents (MCs) and pseudo second-order model were found to best fit the results when active MCs degraders (XC) were used (r2= 0.99). The result of XC estimation showed that SRT plays an important role in formation of the biomass capable of degrading selected MCs. It is also observed that the MCs degraders are naturally present in the AS system even at low SRTs; however, the concentration of XC is dependent on SRT. It is found that biodegradation studies should incorporate XC and not mixed liquor suspended solids concentration (MLSS) in their kinetic formulations."
16,6,2017,"Samuel Legeay, Sébastien Faure",Is bisphenol A an environmental obesogen?,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor with an oestrogenic activity that is widely produced for the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, epoxy resin, and thermal paper. Its ubiquitous presence in the environment contributes to broad and continuous human exposure, which has been associated with deleterious health effects. Despite numerous controversial discussions and a lack of consensus about BPA's safety, growing evidence indicates that BPA exposure positively correlates with an increased risk of developing obesity. An updated analysis of the epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies indicates that BPA should be considered an obesogenic environmental compound. Precisely, BPA exposure during all life stages correlates with increased body weight and/or body mass index. Developmental periods that include prenatal, infancy, and childhood appear to be critical windows with increased sensitivity to BPA effects. Finally, blood analysis and in vitro data clearly demonstrate that BPA promotes adipogenesis, lipid and glucose dysregulation, and adipose tissue inflammation, thus contributing to the pathophysiology of obesity. Future prevention efforts should now be employed to avoid BPA exposure, and more research to determine in depth the critical time windows, doses, and impact of long-term exposure of BPA is warranted in order to clarify its risk assessment."

Although bisphenols F (BPF) and S (BPS) are BPA structural analogs commonly used in many marketed products as a replacement for BPA, only sparse toxicological data are available yet. Our objective was to comprehensively characterize bisphenols gene targets in a human primary adipocyte model, in order to determine whether they may induce cellular dysfunction, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a ""low-dose"" similar to the dose usually encountered in human biological fluids and a higher dose. Therefore, BPA, BPF and BPS have been added at 10 nM or 10 μM during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients. Gene expression (mRNA/lncRNA) arrays and microRNA arrays, have been used to assess coding and non-coding RNA changes. We detected significantly deregulated mRNA/lncRNA and miRNA at low and high doses. Enrichment in ""cancer"" and ""organismal injury and abnormalities"" related pathways was found in response to the three products. Some long intergenic non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed suggesting that bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and epigenetic modifications. The analysis of upstream regulators of deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals suggesting that BPS and BPF can be suspected to interfere, just like BPA, with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine disruptors. All these results suggest that as BPA, its substitutes BPS and BPF should be used with the same restrictions."

When the urinary excretion sample size was large enough and over 1000, it was found that the national estimated BPA daily intakes in the child group among countries, showed a good linear relationship with those of their corresponding adult group. Except the infant group with limited data, the global estimated BPA daily intakes for children and pregnant women were 2 and 1.4 times that of the adult group.

The in-deep experimental and theoretical results provide information about the interactions between PEO800 and BPA. The in situ UV-vis spectroscopy data and the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, and Morris-Webber intraparticle diffusion models allowed us to propose a three-step mechanism for the adsorption of BPA onto PEO800. The results indicate that the pseudo-first-order kinetic model effectively describes the adsorption of BPA onto PEO800. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the interaction of PEO800 with BPA, showing an alteration in the chemical environment of the polymer ether oxygen atoms present in the hybrid matrix. The molecular dynamic simulation provides further evidence that the BPA molecules interact preferentially with PEO. The amount of desorbed BPA depended on the pH and solvent used in the assays. This work provides new opportunities for using the hydrophilic ureasil-PEO matrix which has demonstrated its abilities in being a fast and easy alternative to successfully removing organic contaminants from aqueous mediums and therefore having potential applications in water remediation.

Being lipophilic xenobiotic chemicals, they can be easily absorbed into the biological system from the surrounding environments, thereby causing various health dysfunctions. In the present study, a total of 100 dioxins and DLCs were taken, and their binding pattern was assessed with the xenosensors pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in comparison with the corresponding known inhibitors and a well-studied endocrine disrupting xenobiotic, bisphenol A (BPA). The nuclear receptors CAR and PXR are known to play a significant role in handling potential toxins by coordinating cellular transport and metabolic functions of the same. Among different endocrine-disrupting chemicals used in the present study, DLCs (PCDFs and PCBs) elicited better interactions in comparison with the parent dioxin (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) compounds. On comparing D scores of all the compounds against both the receptors, PCDF 8-hydroxy-3,4-dichlorodibenzofuran (8-OH-DCDF) and PCB tetrachlorobenzyltoluene (TCBT) exhibited significant molecular interactions against PXR (-7.633 kcal mol(-1) ) and CAR (-8.389 kcal mol(-1) ), respectively. Predominant interactions were found to be H-bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic, polar, and van der Waals. By contrast, BPA and some natural ligands tested in this study showed lower binding affinities with these receptors than certain DLCs reported herein, ie, certain DLCs might be more toxic than the proven toxic agent, BPA. Such studies play a pivotal role in the risk assessment of exposure to dioxins and DLCs on human health."

Our aim was to investigate whether perinatal exposure to BPA (50μg/kgday), orally administered, affects ovarian response to exogenous gonadotrophins (PMSG or PMSG+hCG) in prepubertal female offspring. An altered response to gonadotrophins was observed in BPA-exposed rats. Increased proportion of antral follicles, altered levels of ovarian steroidogenic enzymes, gonadotropin receptors, AR and ERβ were observed in PMSG group. Besides that, in response to PMSG+hCG, a persistent high Fshr mRNA expression and a decreased number of follicles with high expression of PR before ovulation were observed. After ovulation, there was an increase in antral atretic follicles, reduced Lhcgr mRNA expression and high serum levels of E2. Therefore, an early exposure to a low dose of BPA during perinatal period induces ovarian changes leading to an altered response to exogenous gonadotropin treatment later in life."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether exposure to BPA during hypothalamic sexual differentiation at doses below the reproductive no observable adverse effect level of the World Health Organization causes changes in the regulation of the HPT axis. For this, 0.5 or 5mgkg-1 BPA was injected subcutaneously to the mothers from gestational day 18 to postnatal day (PND) 5. In adulthood (PND90), the mRNA expression of genes related to HPT axis was evaluated in hypothalamus, pituitary and testis. Hypothalamic expression of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (Gnrh) and estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2) mRNA was increased in both BPA-treated groups compared to control group. In the pituitary, follicle stimulating hormone beta subunit (Fshb) and androgen receptor (Ar) mRNA expression was increased compared to control group in rats treated with 0.5mgkg-1 of BPA, whereas estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) mRNA expression was only increased in the group treated with 5mgkg-1of BPA, compared to control group. In the testis, there was increased expression of FSH receptor (Fshr) and inhibin beta B subunit (Inhbb) transcripts only in rats treated with 0.5mgkg-1 of BPA. Serum testosterone and LH concentrations were increased in the group treated with 5mgkg-1of BPA. The results of the present study demonstrate for the first time that perinatal exposure to low doses of BPA during the critical period of hypothalamic sexual differentiation modifies the activity of the HPT axis in the offspring, with consequences for later life in adult rats."

In 2013-2014, BPA air and hand exposures were quantified for 78 workers at six U.S. companies making BPA or BPA-based products. Exposure measures included an inhalable-fraction personal air sample on each of two consecutive work days (n = 146), pre- and end-shift hand wipe samples on the second day (n = 74 each), and surface wipe samples (n = 88). Potential determinants of BPA air and end-shift hand exposures (after natural log transformation) were assessed in univariate and multiple regression mixed models. The geometric mean (GM) BPA air concentration was 4.0 µg/m(3) (maximum 920 µg/m(3)). The end-shift GM BPA hand level (26 µg/sample) was 10-times higher than the pre-shift level (2.6 µg/sample). BPA air and hand exposures differed significantly by industry and job. BPA air concentrations and end-shift hand levels were highest in the BPA-filled wax manufacturing/reclaim industry (GMAir = 48 µg/m(3), GMHand-End = 130 µg/sample) and in the job of working with molten BPA-filled wax (GMAir = 43 µg/m(3), GMHand-End = 180 µg/sample), and lowest in the phenolic resins industry (GMAir = 0.85 µg/m(3), GMHand-End = 0.43 µg/sample) and in the job of flaking phenolic resins (GMAIR = 0.62 µg/m(3), GMHand-End = 0.38 µg/sample). Determinants of increased BPA air concentration were industry, handling BPA containers, spilling BPA, and spending ≥50% of the shift in production areas; increasing age was associated with lower air concentrations. BPA hand exposure determinants were influenced by high values for two workers; for all other workers, tasks involving contact with BPA-containing materials and spending ≥50% of the shift in production areas were associated with increased BPA hand levels. Surface wipe BPA levels were significantly lower in eating/office areas (GM = 9.3 µg/100 cm(2)) than in production areas (GM = 140 µg/100 cm(2)). In conclusion, worker BPA exposure was associated with tasks and conditions affecting both inhalation and dermal exposure.

Adsorption of EE2 on the marine sediment can be well fitted by the Freundlich model with an affinity coefficient (KF) varying from 15.8 to 39.8L/kg. It was significantly influenced by SOM and the particle properties. Co-presence of BPA brought about a significant competition effect on the adsorption of EE2, leading to a reduced EE2 adsorption. The competitive effect imposed by EE2 to BPA, however, was even more serious owing probably to the large molecular structure and high hydrophobicity of EE2. The sediment sample with the highest SOM and SSA presented a mild competition effect, while the sediment with the lowest SOM and largest particle size exhibited the most serious competition effect."

Sperm counts or motility was significantly reduced by BPA, BPE or BPS exposure on PND 60 or PND 90. Exposure of BPA, BPE and BPS disrupted the progression of germ cell development, as morphometric analyses exhibited an abnormal distribution of the stages of spermatogenesis. In females, postnatal BPA and BPE exposure accelerated the onset of puberty, and increased body weight after parturition. Furthermore, postnatal exposure of BPA, BPE and/or BPS increased steroid hormone levels in serum.

Then, using this optimized desorption conditions, we examined which micropollutants exist in spent carbon filters collected from houses in different regions in Korea where water purifiers were used. A total of 11 micropollutants (caffeine (CFF), acetaminophen (ACT), sulfamethazine (SMA), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), metoprolol (MTP), carbamazepine (CBM), naproxen (NPX), bisphenol-A (BPA), ibuprofen (IBU), diclofenac (DCF), and triclocarban (TCB)) were analyzed using LC/MS-MS from the spent carbon filters. CFF, NPX, and DCF had the highest detection frequencies (>60%) in the carbon filters (n = 100), whereas SMA, SMZ, and MTP were only detected in the carbon filters, but not in the tap waters (n = 25), indicating that these micropollutants, which exist less than the detection limit in tap water, were accumulated in the carbon filters. The regional micropollutant detection patterns in the carbon filters showed higher levels of micropollutants, especially NPX, BPA, IBU, and DCF, in carbon filters collected in the Han River and Nakdong River basins where large cities exist. The levels of micropollutants in the carbon filter were generally lower in the regions where advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) were employed at nearby water treatment plants (WTPs), indicating that AOP process in WTP is quite effective in removing micropollutant. Our results suggest that desorption of micropollutant from the carbon filter used can be a tool to identify micropollutants present in tap water with trace amounts or below the detection limit."

In this study, 11-week-old gonadectomied (GDX) male mice daily received subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate (TP, 0.5mg/kg), TP and BPA (0.4 and 4mg/kg), or vehicle for 45days. The results of Morris water maze task showed that exposure to BPA did not affect the spatial memory of GDX mice but impaired that of sham (4mg/kg/day) and TP-treated GDX mice (0.4mg/kg/day). In addition, BPA reduced the level of testosterone (T) in the serum and brain of sham and TP-treated GDX mice. Exposure to BPA decreased the synaptic density and had an adverse effect on the synaptic interface of the hippocampus in sham and TP-treated GDX mice. The results of western blot analysis further showed that BPA (4mg/kg) reduced the levels of synaptic proteins (synapsin I and PSD-95) and NMDA receptor subunit NR2B in sham and TP-treated GDX mice. BPA decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but increased the phosphorylation of p38 in sham and TP-treated GDX mice. These results suggest that impairment of spatial memory and adverse effects on synaptic remodeling of hippocampal neurons in males after long-term BPA exposure is related to the anti-androgen effect of BPA. These effects of BPA may be associated with downregulated synaptic proteins and NMDA receptor through inhibiting ERKs and promoting the p38 pathways."

The analysis process utilized particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle analysis software to measure drop velocities as well as the distributions of the number of droplets and their respective side view area. The results of this analysis revealed that the maximal velocity in the forward spatter can be about 47±5m/s and for the backward spatter - about 24±8m/s. Moreover, our measurements indicate that the number of droplets produced is larger in forward spatter than it is in backward spatter. In the forward and backward spatter the droplet area in the side-view images is approximately the same. The upper angles of the close-to-cone domain in which droplets are issued in forward and backward spatter are, 27±9° and 57±7°, respectively, whereas the lower angles of the close-to-cone domain are 28±12° and 30±18°, respectively. The inclination angle of the bullet as it penetrates the target is seen to play a large role in the directional preference of the spattered blood. Also, muzzle gases, bullet impact angle, as well as the aerodynamic wake of the bullet are seen to greatly influence the flight of the droplets. The intent of this investigation is to provide a quantitative basis for current and future research on bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) of either forward or backward blood spatter due to a gunshot."

EDCs shown to alter pathways and behaviors coordinated by AVP and/or OT include the plastics component bisphenol A (BPA), the soy phytoestrogen genistein (GEN), and various flame retardants. Many effects are sex specific and likely involve action at nuclear estrogen receptors. Effects include the elimination or reversal of well-characterized sexually dimorphic aspects of the AVP system, including innervation of the lateral septum and other brain regions critical for social and other non-reproductive behaviors. Disruption of magnocellular AVP function has also been reported in rats, suggesting possible effects on hemodynamics and cardiovascular function."

We found that the prior photo-regime, larval age, and/or arena size influence behavioural outcomes in response to toxicant exposure. For example, methodology determined whether 10μM BPA induced hyperactivity, hypoactivity, or had no behavioural effect. Furthermore, the minimum effect concentration was not consistent between different methodologies. Finally, we observed a mechanism previously used to explain hyperactivity following BPA exposure does not appear to explain the hypoactivity observed following minor alterations in methodology. Therefore, we demonstrate how methodology can have notable implications on dose responses and behavioural outcomes in larval zebrafish motility following identical chemical exposures. As such, our results have significant consequences for human and environmental risk assessment."

For bisphenol-S (BPS) and bisphenol-F (BPF) that are BPA analogs and substitutes, their risk to estrogen-dependent cancer has been reported rarely compared with the numerous cases of BPA. In this study, we examined whether BPA, BPS, and BPF can lead to the proliferation, migration, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of MCF-7 clonal variant (MCF-7 CV) breast cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). In a cell viability assay, BPA, BPS, and BPF significantly increased proliferation of MCF-7 CV cells compared to control (DMSO) as did 17β-estradiol (E2). In Western blotting assay, BPA, BPS, and BPF enhanced the protein expression of cell cycle progression genes such as cyclin D1 and E1. In addition, MCF-7 CV cells lost cell to cell contacts and acquired fibroblast-like morphology by the treatment of BPA, BPS, or BPF for 24 hours. In cell migration assay, BPA, BPS, and BPF accelerated the migration capability of MCF-7 CV cells as did E2. In relation with the EMT process, BPA, BPS, and BPF increased the protein expression ofN-cadherin, while they decreased the protein expression of E-cadherin. When BPA, BPS, and BPF were co-treated with ICI 182,780, an ER antagonist, proliferation effects were reversed, the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 was downregulated, and the altered cell migration and expression ofN-cadherin and E-cadherin by BPA, BPS, and BPF were restored to the control level. Thus, these results imply that BPS and BPF also have the risk of breast cancer progression as much as BPA in the induction of proliferation and migration of MCF-7 CV cells by regulating the protein expression of cell cycle-related genes and EMT markersvia the ER-dependent pathway."

Because of concerns for similar effects in humans, there is a desire to replace BPA in consumer products, and a search for BPA replacements that lack endocrine-disrupting bioactivity is ongoing. We used multiple cell-based models, including an established multi-parametric, high throughput microscopy-based platform that incorporates engineered HeLa cell lines with visible ERα- or ERβ-regulated transcription loci, to discriminate the estrogen-like and androgen-like properties of previously uncharacterized substituted bisphenol derivatives and hydroquinone. As expected, BPA induced 70-80% of the estrogen-like activity via ERα and ERβ compared to E2 in the HeLa prolactin array cell line. 2,2' BPA, Bisguaiacol F, CHDM 4-hydroxybuyl acrylate, hydroquinone, and TM modified variants of BPF showed very limited estrogen-like or androgen-like activity (< 10% of that observed with the control compounds). Interestingly, TM-BFP and CHDM 4-hydroxybuyl acrylate, but not their derivatives, demonstrated evidence of anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Our findings indicate that Bisguaiacol F, TM-BFP-ER and TM-BPF-DGE demonstrate low potential for affecting estrogenic or androgenic endocrine activity. This suggest that the tested compounds could be suitable commercially viable alternatives to BPA."

Previous studies have suggested a role of these compounds in the shedding of signaling molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of BPA and NP on the sheddase ADAM17 and its newly discovered regulators iRhom1 and iRhom2 in the release of EGFR-ligands. We report that BPA and NP can stimulate the release of the ADAM17-substrates HB-EGF and TGF-α. In cells lacking ADAM17 (Adam17(-/-) mEFs) BPA-stimulated release of HB-EGF, but not TGF-α, was strongly reduced, whereas NP-stimulated shedding of HB-EGF and TGF-α was completely abolished. Inactivation of both ADAM17 and the related ADAM10 (Adam10/17(-/-) mEFs) completely prevented the release of these substrates. In the absence of iRhom1, BPA- or NP-stimulated release of HB-EGF or TGF-α was comparable to wild-type control mEFs, conversely the BPA-induced release of HB-EGF was abolished in iRhom2(-/-) mEFs. The defect in shedding of HB-EGF in iRhom2(-/-) mEF cells could be rescued by overexpressing iRhom2. Interestingly, the NP-stimulated release of HB-EGF was not affected by the absence of iRhom2, suggesting that NP could potentially activate both ADAM10 and ADAM17. We tested this hypothesis using betacellulin (BTC), an EGFR-ligand that is a substrate for ADAM10. We found that NP, but not BPA stimulated the release of BTC in Adam17(-/-) , iRhom2(-/-) , or iRhom1/2(-/-) , but not in Adam10/17(-/-) cells. Taken together, our results suggest that BPA and NP stimulate the release of EGFR-ligands by differentially activating ADAM17 or ADAM10. The identification of specific effects of these endocrine disruptors on ADAM10 and ADAM17 will help to provide a better understanding of their roles in cell signaling and proinflammatory processes, and provide new potential targets for treatment of reproductive or inflammatory diseases such as asthma or breast cancer that are promoted by xenoestrogens."

However, the mechanisms underlying anti-androgenic effects of BPA remain unclear. The objective of this study was to explore whether the AR signaling was involved in AR antagonism of BPA. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) iCELLigence system were applied to analyze the mouse Sertoli cell TM4 proliferation. The mammalian two-hybrid assays were performed to investigate the effects of BPA on the AR amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions (N/C) interaction and the interactions of the AR with steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), co-repressors including silencing mediator for thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR). BPA exposure resulted in decreased TM4 cell proliferation. BPA inhibited the AR N/C interaction significantly. Furthermore, BPA enhanced the interactions of AR-SMRT and AR-NCoR significantly. In conclusion, these data suggest BPA inhibits Sertoli cell proliferation due to its anti-androgenic actions. The mechanisms responsible for AR antagonism of BPA involve inhibiting the AR N/C interaction and enhancing the interactions of AR-SMRT and AR-NCoR. The data uncover novel anti-androgenic mechanisms by which BPA antagonizes AR signaling, contributing to Sertoli cell proliferation suppression and male reproductive toxicology."

B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences","Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disrupter, is widely used to make chemicals for polycarbonate, plastics, beverage containers, epoxy resins, and cash register receipts. BPA is one of the known xenoestrogens, which have weak estrogenic activity and cause obesity, diabetes, breast cancer, and reproductive disorders. Even though the concentration level of metabolomes in hair is usually lower than that in urine and blood, there are several reasons why we chose to use hair samples. First, the sampling procedure of hairs is simple. Second, it is also easy to preserve the sample for long term and track the drug-exposure record of a given sample. Third, deformation and contamination of samples rarely occur. In this study, an improved analytical method to determine the levels of BPA and estrogens in hair samples was developed by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS). Hair samples were extracted by an Oasis HLB extraction cartridge after incubation with 1N HCl and derivatized with dansyl chloride to increase sensitivity. BPA and estrogens (estrone, 17β-estradiol, and estriol) were separated using Shiseido CAPCELL PAK C18 column (2.0×100mm, 3μm) and a mobile phase consisting of 10mM ammonium acetate in water and acetonitrile with a gradient program at a flow rate of 0.3mL/min and were monitored with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The linearity of this method was over 0.995. The limits of detection (LOD) at a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3 were 0.25-6.0ng/g. The alteration of estrogens levels induced by BPA may play important role to understanding probable endocrine disruptive exposure, and the described methods could be used to evaluate and monitor exposure of endocrine disruptor."

HuF cells were isolated and cultured for eight days in the presence of a decidualization-inducing cocktail, while concurrently exposed to physiological and supra-physiologic doses of BPA (1ng/mL, 10ng/mL, 0.5μg/mL, 10μg/mL and 20μg/mL). Decidualization markers, steroid hormone receptors and cell cycle gene expression were detected by qRT-PCR and cellular proliferation was assessed by KI-67 immunofluorescent staining and MTS assay. BPA impaired decidualization at 10μg/mL and 20μg/mL, but not at lower doses. Additionally, BPA at 20μg/mL decreased progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor-alpha compared to controls. The highest dose of BPA also reduced cellular proliferation and cyclin D2 expression compared to controls. These findings demonstrate that BPA disrupts in vitro decidualization of uterine stromal fibroblasts by altering steroid hormone receptor expression at higher concentrations but not at lower physiological doses."

Screening of baby boomers remains low. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of an electronic health record (EHR) based prompt on HCV screening rates in baby boomers in primary care, and access to specialty care and treatment among those newly diagnosed. We implemented an EHR based ""Best Practice Advisory"" (BPA) that prompted primary care providers (PCPs) to perform HCV screening for patients seen in primary care clinic: 1) born between 1945-1965; 2) lacked a prior diagnosis of HCV infection; and 3) lacked prior documented anti-HCV testing. The BPA had associated educational materials, order set, and streamlined access to specialty care for newly diagnosed patients. Pre and post BPA screening rates were compared and care of newly diagnosed patients analyzed. In the 3 years prior to BPA implementation, 52,660 baby boomers were seen in primary care clinics, and 28% were screened. HCV screening increased from 7.6% for patients with a PCP visit in the 6 months prior to BPA to 72% over the 1-year post BPA.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known global environmental toxicant and a ubiquitous oestrogenic chemical. This study evaluated the role of selenium (0.5 ppm sodium selenite/kg diet) on spermatogenesis after BPA treatment in different groups of male BALB/c mice: control, selenium, BPA and selenium+BPA. Markers of oxidative stress and apoptosis were evaluated in testis after BPA treatment. Significant decrease in sperm concentration and motility and increased reactive oxygen species(ROS) and LPO levels were seen in BPA group. Histopathological changes revealed extensive vacuolisation, lumen devoid of spermatozoa and decreased germ cell count, confirmed by testicular germ cell count studies. TUNEL assay for apoptosis showed increased number of TUNEL-positive germ cells in BPA group with increased percentage apoptotic index. However, in Se+BPA group, histopathological studies revealed systematic array of all germ cells, preserved basement membrane with relatively less vacuolisation, improved sperm parameters and ROS and LPO levels and decreased number of TUNEL-positive germ cells. These results clearly demonstrate the role of selenium in ameliorating oxidative stress and apoptosis induced upon BPA treatment in mice and can be further used as therapeutic target in male infertility."

We hypothesized that BPA improves the efficiency of nutrition-induced catch up growth as compared to sn-1,3 PA, which is present in vegetable oil. Pre-pubertal male rats were subjected to a 17 days food restriction followed by re-feeding for nine days with 1,3 PA or BPA-containing diets. We measured bone length, epiphyseal growth plate height (EGP, histology), bone quality (micro-CT and 3-point bending assay), and gene expression (Affymetrix). The BPA-containing diet improved most growth parameters: humeri length and EGP height were greater in the BPA-fed animals. Further analysis of the EGP revealed that the hypertrophic zone was significantly higher in the BPA group. In addition, Affymetrix analysis revealed that the diet affected the expression of several genes in the liver and EGP. Despite the very subtle difference between the diets and the short re-feeding period, we found a small but significant improvement in most growth parameters in the BPA-fed rats. This pre-clinical study may have important implications, especially for children with growth disorders and children with special nutritional needs."

We found that BPA significantly inhibited CXCL8 expression in DSCs, which hindered trophoblast invasion, and activated the phosphorylation of ERK in DSCs. U0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation, remarkably rescued trophoblast invasion and the inhibition of CXCL8 expression caused by BPA treatment. Moreover, the nuclear estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 and transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 (membrane estrogen receptor) antagonist G15 significantly blocked the phosphorylation of ERK and reversed the reduction of trophoblast invasion.

Fasting blood glucose level of BPA treated groups showed a significant increase, oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were also impaired in these animals. BPA significantly decreased the protein levels of insulin signalling molecules like IR, IRS-1, Akt, AS160 and its phosphorylated forms and blunts GLUT4 translocation by altering the levels of v- and t- SNARE proteins that assist the translocation process, thereby decreasing glucose uptake and oxidation in the gastrocnemius muscle. These results suggest that BPA has detrimental effects on insulin signalling molecules and GLUT4 translocation in the gastrocnemius muscle and thus impairs glucose homeostasis."

Groundwaters were unaffected by EDC contamination, while all classes of compounds were detected at concentrations above the method quantification limit (MQL) in the majority of the river bodies. In detail, PFOA and PFOS concentrations varied between <MQL and 17.7 ng/l (PFOA) and between <MQL and 5.5 ng/l (PFOS), and their occurrence in the aquatic compartment was related to the discharge of wastewater treatment plant effluents. Concerning estrogens, EE2 was below the MQL in all samples, whereas E1 and E2 reached concentrations up to 39.7 ng/l (E2) and 28 ng/l (E1) in surface waters. The highest estrogen values were registered in those areas where livestock and farming are the main activities, indicating a close relation between these activities and estrogen release into the aquatic compartment. BPA (<MQL-171.3 ng/l) distribution in river waters did not show any correlation with a specific anthropic activity; a mixture of sources of contamination (e.g., industries of food packaging and plastic production) is rather responsible for its detection in river bodies. Overall, the northern part of the Romagna area showed a higher contamination by EDCs, in contrast with the southern part, which was almost unaffected by this kind of microcontamination."

The catalyst, consisting of interconnected carbon microspheres with embedded iron and cobalt microparticles, was capable of activating persulfate to form sulfate and hydroxyl radicals at ambient conditions. The pseudo-first order degradation rate of BPA in ultrapure water (UPW) was found to increase with (i) increasing catalyst (25-75 mg/L) and SPS (31-250 mg/L) concentrations, (ii) decreasing BPA concentration (285-14,200 μg/L), and (iii) changing pH from alkaline to acidic values (9-3). Besides UPW, tests were conducted in drinking water, treated wastewater, groundwater and surface water; interestingly, the rate in UPW was always lower than in any other matrix containing several organic and inorganic constituents. The effect of natural organic matter (in the form of humic acids) and alcohols was detrimental to BPA degradation owing to the scavenging of radicals. Conversely, chlorides at concentrations greater than 50 mg/L had a positive effect due to the formation and subsequent participation of chlorine-containing radicals. Liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed to identify major transformation by-products (TBPs) of BPA degradation in the absence and presence of chlorides; in the latter case, several chlorinated TBPs were detected confirming the role of Cl-related radicals.

Furthermore, the mechanism was elucidated by diverse control experiments, such as in the conditions of (1)O2 scavenger, in darkness and with the changes of light sensitizing ligands. It confirmed that BPA was oxidized by the (1)O2 which was generated from porphyrin ligand within MOFs under visible-light.

However, the potential disrupting effects of BPF on aquatic organisms and the underling disrupting mechanisms have not been investigated. In this study, the potential disrupting mechanisms of BPF on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and liver were probed by employing the OECD 21-day short-term fecundity assay in zebrafish. The results show that BPF exposure (1 mg/L) impaired the reproductive function of zebrafish, as exemplified by alterations to testicular and ovarian histology of the treated zebrafish. Homogenate testosterone (T) levels in male zebrafish decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, and 17β-estradiol (E2) levels increased significantly when fish were exposed to 0.1 and 1 mg/L BPF. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine gene expression in the HPG axis and liver. Hepatic vitellogenin expression was significantly upregulated in males, suggesting that BPF possesses estrogenic activity. The disturbed hormone balance was enhanced by the significant changes in gene expression along the HPG axis. These alterations suggest that BPF leads to adverse effects on the endocrine system of teleost fish, and that these effects were more prominent in males than in females."

In this study, we aim to probe the effects of BPA exposure on induction of autophagy in goat Sertoli Cells (gSCs), as well as the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. Results indicated that exposure to BPA (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600μM) decreased the cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure of gSCs to 500μM BPA for 12h resulted in in vitro triggered loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Apoptosis with an increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and higher rates of autophagy, such as autophagosome formation and increased expression of autophagy-related markers were also induced in gSCs exposed to 500μM BPA. Furthermore, treatment with 350nM Rapamycin (Rap, autophagy activator) alleviated a decrease in cell viability, intracellular ROS production, and reduction of ΔΨm, as well as decreasing apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicated that gSCs viability was disrupted after BPA treatment through affecting ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential and inducing autophagy/apoptosis."

This review aims to evaluate the impact of environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals [phthalates, parabens, triclosan, bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine (PCBs) and perfluorinated (PFCs) compounds] on the reproductive potential among women, by reviewing most recently published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on EDCs exposure and reproductive potential among women for the last 16 years were identified by a search of the PUBMED, MEDLINE, EBSCO and TOXNET literature databases. The results of the presented studies show that exposure to EDCs impacts the reproductive potential in women, measured by ovarian reserve and by assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals decrease: (i) oestradiol levels (BPA); (ii) anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations (PCBs); (iii) antral follicle count (BPA, parabens, phthalates); (iv) oocyte quality (BPA, triclosan, phthalates, PCBs); (v) fertilization rate (PFCs, PCBs); (vi) implantation (BPA, phthalates, PCBs); (vii) embryo quality (triclosan, PCBs, BPA); (viii) rate of clinical pregnancy and live births (parabens, phthalates). The studies were mostly well-designed and used prospective cohorts with the exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposure. Considering the suggested health effects, more epidemiological data is urgently needed to confirm the presented findings."

BPA increased EVT motility and the outgrowth of villous explants in a dose-dependent manner. BPA also increased the protein levels of integrin-β1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in human EVTs. Low-dose BPA (≤50 mg) increased the protein levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 as well as integrin-β1 and integrin-α5 in mouse placenta and decreased the proportion of the labyrinth and spongiotrophoblast layers. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) U0126 and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) LY294002 reversed the protein levels of integrin-β1 and MMP-9 as well as the migratory ability induced by BPA.

However, effects of BPA exposure on synaptic plasticity and the underlying physiological mechanisms remain elusive. Our behavioral and electrophysiological analyses show that BPA obviously perturbs hippocampal spatial memory of juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats after four weeks exposure, with significantly impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. These effects involve decreased spine density of pyramidal neurons, especially the apical dendritic spine. Further presynaptic findings show an overt inhibition of pulse-paired facilitation during electrophysiological recording, which suggest the decrease of presynaptic transmitter release and is consistent with reduced production of presynaptic glutamate after BPA exposure. Meanwhile, LTP-related glutamate receptors, NMDA receptor 2A (NR2A) and AMPA receptor 1 (GluR1), are significantly downregulated in BPA-exposed rats. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) results also show that EPSCNMDA, but not EPSCAMPA, is declined by 40% compared to the baseline in BPA-perfused brain slices. Taken together, these findings reveal that juvenile BPA exposure has negative effects on synaptic plasticity, which result from decreases in dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic transmission. Importantly, this study also provides new insights into the dynamics of BPA-induced memory deterioration during the whole life of rats."

The results showed that CTAB-Ms(x) had a core/shell structure in which the core was a CTAB micelle and the shell was SiO2. The prepared material was applied to adsorb bisphenol A (BPA). Pseudo-first-order kinetics equation, pseudo-second-order kinetics equation, Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, Temkin adsorption isotherm model, and thermodynamic equations were used to fit and analyze the experiment results. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacities calculated according to linear and non-linear forms of the Langmuir isotherm were 370.37 mg*g(-1) and 198.80 mg*g(-1), and the adsorption equilibrium time was 120 min.

Although a comprehensive understanding of the adverse effect of BPA on behaviors and physiology have been proven, the potential impact of low-dose BPA on altering the basic ability of aquatic organism in adapting to the surrounded complex environment still remains elusive. In this research, we report that treatment of adult male zebrafish with chronic (7 weeks) low-dose (0.22 nM-2.2 nM) BPA, altered the ability in adapting the complex environment by disturbing the natural color preference patterns. In addition, chronic 50 ng/L (0.22 nM) BPA exposure alleviated the anxiety behavior of male zebrafish confronted with the novel environment by enhancing the preference towards light in the light/dark preference test. This phenotype was associated with less expression of serotonin (5-TH) in the hypothalamus and the down-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in brain tissues. As such, our results show that low-dose BPA remnant in surface waters altered zebrafish behavior that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences."

Fathead minnows were deployed in cages for 2, 4, or 8 days at three locations near two different wastewater treatment plant discharge sites in the Saint Louis Bay, Duluth, MN and one upstream reference site. The biological impact of 51 chemicals detected in the surface water of 133 targeted chemicals was determined using biochemical endpoints, exposure activity ratios for biological and estrogenic responses, known chemical:gene interactions from biological pathways and knowledge bases, and analysis of the covariance of ovary gene expression with surface water chemistry. Thirty-two chemicals were significantly linked by covariance with expressed genes. No estrogenic impact on biochemical endpoints was observed in male or female minnows. However, bisphenol A (BPA) was identified by chemical:gene covariation as the most impactful estrogenic chemical across all exposure sites. This was consistent with identification of estrogenic effects on gene expression, high BPA exposure activity ratios across all test sites, and historical analysis of the study area. Gene expression analysis also indicated the presence of nontargeted chemicals including chemotherapeutics consistent with a local hospital waste stream. Overall impacts on gene expression appeared to be related to changes in treatment plant function during rain events. This approach appears useful in examining the impacts of complex mixtures on fish and offers a potential route in linking chemical exposure to adverse outcomes that may reduce population sustainability."

We find that construction, production of educational and recreational products, and automobile manufacturing are the most BPA-intensive sectors in terms of total BPA flows (300, 157, and 130 Gg total BPA flows, respectively). The public management and health sectors, however, incur significant indirect BPA flows, defined as embedded and inter-sectoral BPA placed into use, even though direct BPA use by these sectors is limited. By revealing the currently overlooked indirect BPA flows, this study reveals data gaps that are highly relevant to improving the accuracy of estimated BPA flows and losses.

We previously showed that dietary exposure to 10 µg/kg body weight (bw)/d and 10 mg/kg bw/d of bisphenol A (BPA) during pregnancy induced metabolic abnormalities in F1 male offspring and gestational glucose intolerance in F0 pregnant mice. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying etiologies of BPA exposure-induced metabolic disease by analyzing the male fetal liver metabolome. Using the Metabolon Discover HD4 Platform, our laboratory identified metabolic pathways that were altered by BPA exposure, including biochemicals in lipid and amino acid metabolism. Specifically, primary and secondary bile acids were increased in liver from BPA-exposed embryonic day 18.5 male fetuses. We subsequently showed that increased bile acid was associated with a defective farnesoid X receptor-dependent negative feedback mechanism in BPA-exposed fetuses. In addition, through metabolomics, we observed that BPA-exposed fetuses had elevated tryptophan levels. Independent liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry measurement revealed that BPA-exposed dams also had increased tryptophan levels relative to those of controls. Because several key enzymes in tryptophan catabolism are vitamin B6 dependent and vitamin B6 deficiencies have been linked to gestational diabetes, we tested the impact of vitamin B6 supplementation and showed that it rescued gestational glucose intolerance in BPA-exposed pregnant mice. Our study has therefore identified two pathways (bile acid and tryptophan metabolism) that potentially underlie BPA-induced maternal and fetal metabolic disease."

It was found that BPA degradation was along with the occurrence of laccase production, and wheat bran and corn straw were identified as suitable mixed substrates for laccase production. In the process of BPA degradation with T. versicolor, laccase activity increased rapidly at the 6th-10th day after inoculation. Moreover, BPA can enhance the production of laccase. After 10 days of fermentation, degradation rate of BPA exceeded 90% without the usage of mediators ABTS and acetosyringone at pH 4.0-8.0. In addition, metal ions did not affect the BPA degradation with T. versicolor. In vitro, the optimum pH range of BPA degradation with laccase was in the acidic region with the optimal performance of pH 5.0. Metal ions Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Co(2+) showed little effect on BPA degradation. However, Fe(3+) and Fe(2+) substantially inhibited the BPA degradation. Natural mediator acetosyringone showed optimum enhancement on BPA degradation. Greater than 90% of the estrogenic activity of BPA was removed by T. versicolor and its laccase. Compared to in vitro degradation with laccase, this study shows that the process of simultaneous laccase production and BPA degradation with T. versicolor was more advantageous since BPA can enhance the laccase production, mediators were unnecessary, degradation rate was not affected by metal ions, and the applicable pH range was broader. This study concludes that T. versicolor and laccase have great potential to treat industrial wastewater containing BPA."

The method is based on charge transfer-sensitive ion-pairing complex formation between BPA and Safranin T in the presence of nitrate in a micellar interface at pH 5.0. The variables affecting extraction efficiency were optimized. A good linear relationship with a significant sensitivity difference was obtained in the ranges of 2-40 and 2-120 µg/L with LODs of 0.54 and 0.38 µg/L after preconcentration with two different extractants, respectively. From a preconcentration of a 15 mL sample, a preconcentration factor of 60 was obtained.

In this study, we present a non-targeted LC-MS based metabolomic analysis in combination with a full-genome, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to reveal the metabolic effects and the subjacent regulatory pathways of exposing zebrafish embryos to BPA during the first 120 hours post-fertilization. We applied multivariate data analysis methods to extract biochemical information from the LC-MS and RNA-Seq complex datasets and to perform testable predictions of the phenotypic adverse effects. Metabolomic and transcriptomic data revealed a similar subset of altered pathways, despite the large difference in the number of identified biomarkers (around 50 metabolites and more than 1000 genes).

Male mice (4 wk old) were treated with BPA (50 or 500 μg/kg/day) for 8 wk. Whole-body glucose homeostasis, pancreatic islet morphology and function, and miR-338-mediated molecular signal transduction analyses were examined. We showed that BPA treatment led to a disruption of glucose tolerance and a compensatory increase of pancreatic islets insulin secretion and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) expression in mice. Inhibition of Pdx1 reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and ATP production in the islets of BPA-exposed mice. Based on primary pancreatic islets, we also confirmed that miR-338 regulated Pdx1 and thus contributed to BPA-induced insulin secretory dysfunction from compensation to decompensation. Short-term BPA exposure downregulated miR-338 through activation of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (Gpr30), whereas long-term BPA exposure upregulated miR-338 through suppression of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (Glp1r). Taken together, our results reveal a molecular mechanism, whereby BPA regulates Gpr30/Glp1r to mediate the expression of miR-338, which acts to control Pdx1-dependent insulin secretion.

The efficiency of removal of COD, BPA, and TSS in MF was similar to that in UF; however, it was achieved at a lower pressure, which reduces energy consumption during the filtration process. Despite the similar quality of the permeates in MF and UF, the permeate flux averaged almost 20% higher in UF than in MF. The rejection coefficients were 77-82% for COD and 48-100% for BPA. In both MF and UF, TSS were totally removed. In the integrated system of aerobic granular sludge reactor and membrane installation, total removal of COD was 92-95% and that of BPA was above 98%, independently of the membrane technique. The high efficiency of BPA removal in MF and UF, despite pore sizes in the MF and UF membranes larger than the BPA molecules, suggests that some part of the BPA was first bound by particulate organic matter in the biologically treated wastewater before this sorbed form was removed by the membranes. Furthermore, the high removal of COD and BPA, even in MF, was attributed to adsorption on the membranes, in addition to sieve retention."

Any sort of impairment in their synthesis may lead to the generation of numerous ill health effects. Different environmental toxicants, including bisphenols and their analogs pose deleterious effect on the biosynthesis of glucocorticoids, thereby leading to endocrine disruption. In order to assess the effect of these environmental toxicants on gluocorticoid biosynthetic pathway, an in silico study was performed. This involved molecular docking studies of 18 ligands with the selected participating enzymes of the pathway. These enzymes were CYP11A1, CYP11B2, CYP19A1, CYP17A1, 3α/20β-HSD, 3β/17β-HSD and CYP21A2. Comparison of their binding affinity was made with the known inhibitors of these enzymes. In case of CYP11A1, Bisphenol M (BP M) had the lowest docking score (D score) of -8.699 kCal/mol, and was better than that of the standard, Metyrapone. Bisphenol PH (BP PH) was found to have significant affinity with CYP11B2. In case CYP19A1, results were found to be comparable with the standards, Exemestane and Letrozole. BP PH elicited better results than the standard Abiraterone acetate against CYP17A1. BP M had a D score of -7.759 against 3α/20β-HSD, again better results than the standard, Trilostane. Upon molecular docking of BP PH against CYP21A2, it was seen that amongst all the analogs, it had maximum interactions along with the lowest D score. From all the above instances mentioned, it is quite evident that certain BPA analogs have more potential to modulate the enzymes involved in comparison to the known inhibitors."

However, predictive factors of lung injury after BPA have not been established. Pulmonary artery (PA) dilatation is often observed in patients with pulmonary hypertension. We investigated the association between PA diameter and complications after BPA.The subjects were 19 CTEPH patients who underwent BPA. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with lung injury including asymptomatic lung infiltration on computed tomography (CT) images or mild hemoptysis (group L, n = 9) and no complications (group N, n = 10). PA diameter was measured on CT and corrected by the body surface area (PA diameter index).There were no significant differences in hemodynamic indices or the number of treated vessels between the two groups. Right, left, and main PA diameter indices were higher in group L than in group N. Among the clinical variables, the right, left, and main PA diameter indices were significant predictors for lung injury caused by BPA (right PA: OR 1.819, 95%CI 1.056-3.135, P < 0.05; left PA: OR 1.857, 95%CI 1.091-3.159, P < 0.05; main PA: OR 1.399, 95%CI 1.001-1.956, P < 0.05).The PA diameter index can be used to effectively predict the risk of lung injury after BPA."

A,"A sensitive, rapid and efficient ionic liquid-based vortex assisted liquid-liquid microextraction (IL-VALLME) with Liquid Chromatography Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method is proposed for the determination of bisphenols in thermal paper. Extraction factors were systematically optimized by response surface methodology.

The limit of detection for Bisphenol-A (BPA) and Bisphenol-S (BPS) in thermal paper were 1.25 and 0.93μgkg(-1) respectively. The dynamic linearity range for BPA was between 4 and 100μgkg(-1) and the determination of coefficient (R(2)) was 0.996. The values of the same parameters were 3-100μgkg(-1) and 0.998 for BPS. The extraction recoveries of BPA and BPS in thermal paper were 101% and 99%.

In the present study, we determined the bioaccumulation potential of bisphenol A (BPA) in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in the absence and presence of nano-sized plastic particles (nanoplastics, NPPs). Results show that BPA can accumulate in the viscera, gill, head and muscle of zebrafish with 85, 43, 20, and 3μg/g ww after 1d exposure. NPPs were also found to accumulate in different tissues of the fish. Relative equilibrium was reached after 1d exposure in different tissues with 39 to 636mg/kg ww. Co-exposure of NPPs and BPA led to a 2.2 and 2.6-fold significant increment of BPA uptake in the head and viscera, if compared with BPA alone treatment after 3d exposure. As such, we further investigated several neurotoxic biomarker alterations in the fish head. It was found that either BPA or NPPs can cause myelin basic protein (MBP)/gene up-regulation in the central nervous system (CNS); meanwhile, both contaminants exhibited significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which is a well-known representative biomarker for neurotoxicity. Moreover, for the co-exposure treatment, biomarkers of myeline and tubulin protein/gene expressions, dopamine content, and the mRNA expression of mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) were all significantly up-regulated, suggesting that an enhanced neurotoxic effects in both CNS and dopaminergic system occurred. However, AChE activity was no more inhibited in the co-exposure treatment, which implies that solely AChE measurement may not be sufficient to identify neurotoxic effects in the cholinergic system. Overall, the present study demonstrates that the presence of NPPs can increase BPA bioavailability and cause neurotoxicity in adult zebrafish."

In this work, biochar was prepared to study the removal efficiencies of Cr(VI), naphthalene (NAP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in the single or mixed systems. H3PO4-treated biochar presented a much higher adsorption capacity of the pollutants than the untreated biochar and also showed a high resistance to coexisting salts. The maximum adsorption capacities for Cr(VI) and BPA were 116.28 mg g(-1) and 476.19 mg g(-1), respectively. Coadsorption experiments revealed that the presence of organic pollutants caused a limited decrease (∼10%) of removal efficiency of Cr(VI) and no further decrease was observed with higher concentrations of organic pollutants, while the presence of Cr(VI) had little impact on the removal of NAP. Infrared spectra and molecular simulation demonstrated that Cr(VI) was mainly adsorbed on the biochar via chemical complexation, while the organic pollutants through π-π interaction. Unexpectedly, the addition of Cr(VI) increased the removal efficiency of BPA, probably due to the increased H-bond interactions between BPA and the biochar through bridge bonds of oxygenic groups from CrO4(2-)."

Consequently, there is an impetus to identify safer alternatives to BPA. Three bisphenol compounds proposed as potential safer alternatives to BPA are bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol AF (BPAF). However, it is not clear whether these other compounds are safer in terms of inducing less endocrine disrupting effects in animals and humans who are now increasingly coming into contact with these BPA-substitutes. In the past few years, several animal studies have shown exposure to these other bisphenols induce similar neurobehavioral disruption as BPA. We will explore in this review article the current studies suggesting these other bisphenols result in neuroendocrine disruptions that may be estrogen receptor-dependent. Current work may aide in designing future studies to test further whether these BPA-substitutes can act as neuroendocrine disruptors."

Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 × 10(6) DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre ≥1), i.e., 13 ± 15 vs 271 ± 128 mm(3). In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 ± 15 vs 254 ± 251 mm(3).

Available data have indicated that brain insulin resistance may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the associated mechanisms that underlie BPA-induced brain-related outcomes remain largely unknown. In the present study, we identified significant insulin signaling disturbances in the SH-SY5Y cell line that were mediated by BPA, including the inhibition of physiological p-IR Tyr1355 tyrosine, p-IRS1 tyrosine 896, p-AKT serine 473 and p-GSK3α/β serine 21/9 phosphorylation, as well as the enhancement of IRS1 Ser307 phosphorylation; these effects were clearly attenuated by insulin and rosiglitazone. Intriguingly, Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated pathological proteins, such as BACE-1, APP, β-CTF, α-CTF, Aβ 1-42 and phosphorylated tau proteins (S199, S396, T205, S214 and S404), were substantially increased after BPA exposure, and these effects were abrogated by insulin and rosiglitazone treatment; these findings underscore the specific roles of insulin signaling in BPA-mediated AD-like neurotoxicity. Thus, an understanding of the regulation of insulin signaling may provide novel insights into potential therapeutic targets for BPA-mediated AD-like neurotoxicity."

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is one of the important pollutants in aquatic ecosystems and its detrimental effect on fish has a great concern. Propolis is a natural immune-stimulant that has various biological and pharmacological activities. Thus, its capability to alleviate the toxic effect of BPA on Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.) performance was assessed in a study based on a 2×2 factorial design with two levels of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) and two waterborne BPA concentrations in triplicates. Fish (33.9±0.55g) were exposed to 0.0 or 1.64μgBPA/L for 6weeks during which fish were fed on diets containing 0.0 or 9.0gEEP/kg diet. Fish performance, biochemical variables, and oxidative stress enzymes were significantly affected by propolis supplementation, BPA exposure, and their interaction. Propolis supplementation significantly improved fish growth and feed intake, which were significantly retarded by BPA exposure. Additionally, total protein, albumin, globulin, and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) decreased significantly. Meanwhile aspartate transferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, and uric acid increased significantly with exposure to BPA. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities increased significantly due to BPA exposure, whereas significant reductions in the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were also recorded compared to the control fish. It is noticed that EEP co-administration ameliorated these parameters. The present results evoked that propolis administration improves fish growth and alleviated BPA-induced toxicity."

In the present study, we evaluated the antiproliferative activity of DRS-B2 on numerous tumor cell lines, its cell internalization and studies of its molecular partners as well as their influences on its structure. Confocal microscopy using ([Alexa594]-(Cys0)-DRS-B2) shows that in sensitive human tumor cells (PC3), DRS-B2 seems to accumulate rapidly at the cytoplasmic membranes and enters the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while in less sensitive tumor cells (U87MG), DRS-B2 is found packed in vesicles at the cell membrane. Furthermore FACS analysis shows that PC3 cells viability decreases after DRS-B2 treatment while U87 MG seems to be unaffected. However, ""pull down"" experiments performed with total protein pools from PC3 or U87MG cells and the comparison between the antiproliferative effect of DRS-B2 and its synthetic analog containing all D-amino acids suggest the absence of a stereo-selective protein receptor. Pretreatment of PC3 cells with sodium chlorate, decreases the antiproliferative activity of DRS-B2. This activity is partially restored after addition of exogenous chondroitin sulfate C (CS-C). Moreover, we demonstrate that at nanomolar concentrations CS-C potentiates the antiproliferative effect of DRS-B2. These results highlight the partial implication of glycosaminoglycans in the mechanism of antiproliferative action of DRS-B2. Structural analysis of DRS-B2 by circular dichroism in the presence of increasing concentration of CS-C shows that DRS-B2 adopts an α-helical structure. Finally, structure-activity-relationship studies suggest a key role of the W residue in position 3 of the DRS-B2 sequence for its antiproliferative activity."

Considering this, we analyzed the effects of both TBBPA and TCBPA at 1, 10, and 50nM on ovarian cancer cell proliferation. The majority of malignant ovarian tumors are epithelial in origin, but approximately 10% are classified as ovarian sex cord tumors, with the most common type being granulosa cell tumors (GCTs). OVCAR-3 and KGN cells were used as in vitro models to represent EOCs and GCTs, respectively. Here, we found that TBBPA, but not TCBPA, stimulated OVCAR-3 and KGN cell proliferation, with lower potency than BPA. The stimulatory effects of TBBPA and BPA on cell proliferation were reversed by pre-treatment with a G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) antagonist in both cell lines, which possess similar basal GPR30 expression levels. Taken together, our results show for the first time that TBBPA, which has lower potency than BPA, stimulates ovarian cancer cell proliferation through the GPR30 pathway."

The BPA probes are converted to the corresponding benzocoumarins (BZCs) at different rates depending on the mechanism of oxidation; thus, two probes used simultaneously can differentiate strong triplet excited state sensitizers from hydroxylating species such as hydroxyl radical ((*)OH) present in dissolved organic matter (DOM). Comparison of the ratios of BZC-CH3 and BZC-CF3 product formation using model photooxidants such as NaNO2, a (*)OH precursor, and model triplet sensitizer lumichrome gave a range of 2 to 250. Application of these probes to DOM isolates and whole natural waters afforded intermediate ratios. Although the oxidation potential of BPAs (>ca. 1.80 V SHE) is significantly higher than the estimated average reduction potential of typical (3)CDOM* samples, these results have demonstrated the presence of a small pool of oxidants in the selected DOM isolates and whole water samples that is capable of oxidizing aromatic carboxylates. As an analytical tool, this probe pair can be used between pH 4-6 without affecting the product formation ratio and may find applications in various systems involving complex mixtures of photochemically produced oxidants of differing natures."

The deleterious effects of BPA exposure during periods of brain development have been documented mainly concerning the impairment in memory functions. Diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)2, an organoselenium compound, shows protective/restorative effects against memory deficits in experimental models. Thus, this study investigated the effects of (PhSe)2 on the memory impairments induced by BPA exposure to male and female mice and the possible involvement of glutamatergic system in these effects. Three-week-old male and female Swiss mice received BPA (5mg/kg), intragastrically, from 21st to 60th postnatal day. After, the animals were intragastrically treated with (PhSe)2 (1mg/kg) during seven days. The mice performed the behavioral memory tests and the [(3)H] glutamate uptake and NMDA receptor subunits (2A and 2B) analyses were carried out in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice. The results demonstrated that the BPA exposure induced impairment of object recognition memory in both sexes. However, it caused impairments in spatial memory in female and in the passive avoidance memory in male mice. Besides, BPA caused a decrease in the [(3)H] glutamate uptake and NMDA receptor subunit levels in the cortical and hippocampal regions depending on the sex. Treatment with (PhSe)2 reversed in a sex-independent manner the behavioral impairments and molecular alterations. In conclusion, BPA had a negative effect in different memory types as well as in the glutamatergic parameters in a sex-dependent manner and (PhSe)2 treatment was effective against these alterations."

Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) may mimic their immune effects. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are pivotal initiators of immune responses upon activation by danger signals coming from pathogens or distressed tissues through triggering of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We generated in vitro murine cDCs in the absence of estrogens and measured the effects of exogenously added estrogen or BPA on their differentiation and activation by the TLR ligands LPS and CpG. Estrogen enhanced the differentiation of GM-CSF-dependent cDCs from bone marrow precursors in vitro, and the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen and fulvestrant blocked these effects. Moreover, estrogen augmented the upregulation of costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12p70 and TNFα) upon stimulation by TLR9 ligand CpG, while the response to LPS was less estrogen-dependent. These effects are partially explained by an estrogen-dependent regulation of TLR9 expression. BPA did not promote cDC differentiation nor activation upon TLR stimulation. Our results suggest that estrogen promotes immune responses by increasing DC activation, with a preferential effect on TLR9 over TLR4 stimulation, and highlight the influence of estrogens in DC cultures, while BPA does not mimic estrogen in the DC functions that we tested."

Xenobiotica. 2017;3:1-13.). We reported that the extrapolations of hepatic CL of BPA, NAP, and the binary mixtures between 2 ALB concentrations did not follow the free drug hypothesis; however, potential ALB-facilitated hepatic uptake mechanism(s) were highly suspected. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to reanalyze the IPRL data to provide a deeper quantitative extrapolation of CL; however, the focus was made on the impact of ALB binding on the intrinsic clearance (CLint) versus unbound CLint instead of only the global hepatic CL to verify whether the concept of ALB-facilitated hepatic uptake still holds for these 2 additional parameters for binary mixtures. Firstly, the variations in CLint that were observed between the IPRL model using no ALB and ALB in the perfusates were compared to the corresponding variations in the unbound fraction measured in the perfusates (fup) according to the free drug hypothesis, or to the variations in the fup values adjusted for potential ALB-facilitated uptake mechanism (i.e., fup-adjusted). The parameter fup-adjusted showed a greater predictability compared to fup (average fold error ∼ 1 vs. 5.2), suggesting that both the free and bound drug moieties should be available for hepatic uptake. Secondly, the supplemental data analysis showed a greater decrease in unbound Km than in Vmax resulting in increased uptake CLint of the unbound drug (Vmax/unbound Km) with increased ALB concentration at a given substrate concentration, which is compatible with an ALB-facilitated hepatic uptake mechanism. Interestingly, the unbound CLint increased by a factor that corresponds to the bound drug moiety also assumed available for hepatic uptake. These additional findings corroborate the recent literature. Overall, this study showed the importance of quantifying any differential of ALB concentration (in vitro vs. in vivo or hypoalbuminemia in vivo vs. hyperalbuminemia in vivo) in the IPRL-based, in vitro-to-in vivo or in vivo-to-in vivo extrapolation-based or physiologically based pharmacokinetics-based CL prediction of chemical-drug interactions between xenobiotics significantly bound to ALB."

We found that blastocyst formation was impaired and the parthenotes were arrested at the 4-cell stage after treatment with 100 μm BPA. Second, ROS increased following the addition of BPA, which further caused mitochondrial damage, and cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria to induce apoptosis. The adaptive response was demonstrated through LC3 immunofluorescence staining and by assessing autophagy-related gene expression.

Consistent with the WHO definition of an endocrine disrupter, a key issue is the ""altered function(s) of the endocrine system"". Such altered functions can result from different chemical interactions, beyond agonistic or antagonistic effect at a given receptor. Based on neuroendocrine disruption by polychlorinated biphenyls and bisphenol A, this paper proposes different mechanistic paradigms that can result in adverse health effects. They are a consequence of altered endocrine function(s) secondary to chemical interaction with different steps in the physiological regulatory processes, thus accounting for a possibly indirect endocrine mode of action."

Unfortunately, much less attention has been given to other compounds, which are also used for the production of these materials. Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is a synthetic industrial compound obtained by a condensation reaction between epichlorohydrin (ECH) and BPA. Similarly, novolac glycidyl ether (BFDGE) is produced in the reaction between novolac and epichlorohydrin. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information on the combined effects of BADGE derivatives at environmentally relevant levels. In the current study, toxicity levels in Microtox® and XenoScreen YES/YAS assays were determined for several analogues alone, then the biological effects of compound pairs mixed in 33, 66 and 100% of each compounds' EC50 ratios were evaluated. The Microtox® test has been chosen as a relevant tool, and the results were referred to the Xenoscreen YES/YAS assay, which has been chosen for the fast determination of the endocrine potential of the compounds tested. The results obtained constitutes the basis for model studies, with Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA), followed by Model Deviation Ratio (MDR) interpretation, to evaluate the possible interactions occurring between analytes when present in mixtures. The results indicate that the hydrochloric derivatives of BADGE and BFDGE are of the greatest toxicological and endocrine threat. Thus, their presence in mixtures under certain environmental conditions (including presence in the tissues of living organisms) should be strictly monitored and reported, especially in acidic environments. Strong evidence on the synergic behaviors of these analytes, which expressed high toxicity (EC50 2.69-117.49μg/mL), is demonstrated with Model Deviation Ratio (MDR)."

These products were synthesized from the corresponding metal(ii) chlorides, H2cpna, NaOH, and optional N-donor supporting ligands or templates {bis(4-pyridyl)amine (bpa), 2,2'-bipyridine (2,2'-bipy), 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bipy), or 1,10-phenanthroline (phen)}. Products 1-13 were characterized in the solid state by standard methods, including elemental and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), IR spectroscopy, and powder (PXRD) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structures of 1-13 feature distinct structural types, namely the 3D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs 1-3), the 2D coordination polymers (5, 6, 10, 12, and 13), the 1D coordination polymers (4, 8, and 9), and the 0D discrete cyclic dimers (7 and 11). Such a wide structural diversity of 1-13 is driven by various factors, including the type of the metal(ii) node, the deprotonation degree of H2cpna, and/or the type of supporting ligand or template. Notably, an addition of bpa can tune the structure of MOF 3 by the template effect. Topological classification of underlying metal-organic networks was performed, leading to several distinct topological nets: rtl (in 1), hxg-d-4-C2/m (in 2), sra (in 3), 2C1 (in 4, 8 and 9), fes (in 5, 10, and 12), hcb (in 6), and 3,4L83 (in 13).

The integrated model was built by Delft3D suite, a fully integrated multidimensional modeling software. Atrazine and Bisphenol A (BPA) were selected as two representative emerging contaminants for the study in this reservoir. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated against observations from 2011 to 2015 while the integrated model was calibrated against observations from 2014 to 2015 and then applied to explore the potential risk of high atrazine concentrations in the reservoir driven by agriculture activities. Our results show that the model is capable of describing the spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature, salinity and the dynamic distributions of two representative emerging contaminants (i.e. atrazine and BPA) in the reservoir. The physical and biodegradation processes in this study were found to play a crucial role in determining the fate and transport of atrazine and BPA in the reservoir. The model also provides an insight into the potential risk of emerging contaminants and possible mitigation thresholds. The integrated approach can be a very useful tool to support policy-makers in the future management of Qingcaosha Reservoir."

It has been detected in drinking water sources in many countries. This study deals with the adsorptive removal of BPA using nylon 6,6 nanofibrous membrane (NNM) fabricated by electrospinning technique. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models (R(2)=0.99) were obeyed for BPA adsorption, which indicates the monolayer adsorption of BPA and also surface heterogeneity of NNM. The adsorption kinetics of BPA was followed pseudo second order rate (R(2)=0.89-0.99), which suggests the occurrence of rapid adsorption rate through interaction of surface functional groups present in NNM. The maximum adsorption of BPA (91.3mgg(-1)) was attained at 30°C. The hydroxyl groups of BPA form hydrogen bonding with carbonyl groups of NNM during the adsorptive removal process. Reusability study confirmed a much better stability of NNM in the recyclic application. Finally, this study suggests that NNM might be an outstanding nano-adsorbent for the emerging contaminants removal, including BPA from drinking water sources."

Exposure to low concentrations of BPA occurs in freshwater and marine systems, primarily from wastewater treatment plant discharges. The dataset for chronic toxicity of BPA to freshwater organisms includes studies on fish, amphibians, invertebrates, algae and aquatic plants. To broaden the dataset, a 1.5-generation test with sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) and a full life-cycle test with mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia) were conducted. Testing focused on apical endpoints of survival, growth and development, and reproduction. The NOEC and LOEC values of 170 and 370 µg/L for mysid and 66 and 130 µg/L for sheepshead were based on reduced fecundity. HC5 values of 18 µg/L were calculated from species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) with freshwater-only data and combined freshwater and marine data. Inclusion of marine data resulted in no apparent difference in SSD shape, R(2) values for the distributions, or HC5 values. Upper-bound 95(th) percentile concentrations of BPA measured in marine waters of North America and Europe (0.024 and 0.15 µg/L, respectively) are below the HC5 value of 18 µg/L. These results suggest that marine and freshwater species are of generally similar sensitivity and that chronic studies using a diverse set of species can be combined to assess the aquatic toxicity of BPA.

In this study, we examined the effects of 17β-estradiol (E2), two endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), triclosan (TCS), and bisphenol A (BPA) and DIM on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic behaviors of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. An in vitro assay revealed that E2 (10(-9) M), TCS (10(-5)-10(-7) M), and BPA (10(-5)-10(-7) M) induced MCF-7 cell proliferation compared to a control through the ER pathway. In addition, E2, TCS, and BPA changed the cell morphology from the epithelial to the mesenchymal phenotype, and increased the migration and invasion capacity of MCF-7 cells via ER; however, co-treatment with DIM (20 μM) effectively suppressed E2, TCS, and BPA-induced cell proliferation, EMT, migration, and invasion of MCF-7 cells. Western blot assay revealed that DIM regulated the protein expression of EMT- and metastasis-related genes toward the inhibition of these processes. Moreover, E2, TCS, and BPA increased the protein expression of CXCR4, which is a receptor of chemokine CXCL12 that is positively involved in breast cancer metastasis, via an ER-dependent pathway. Conversely, DIM and a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) decreased CXCR4 protein expression, which led to inhibition of the EMT process, indicating that DIM may suppress E2, TCS or BPA-induced EMT, migration, and invasion of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by suppressing CXCR4 protein expression. These in vitro effects of E2, TCS, BPA, and DIM were also identified in a xenografted mouse model transplanted with MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Taken together, DIM is a potent chemopreventive compound for preventing metastatic behaviors of breast cancer cells induced by EDCs with cancer-related toxicity."

The photocatalytic properties of the photocatalysts are evaluated by the degradation of refractory azo-dye methyl orange (MO), hexavalent chromium Cr(VI), and bisphenol A (BPA) in water under visible light irradiation. It is found that the as-prepared composite with 4 wt% CNTs shows an optimal photocatalytic performance, and its photocatalytic activity is 30% higher than that of pure Bi4VO8Cl. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the synergetic effects induced by increased light absorption, increased adsorption efficiency for pollutant, and suppressed recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, efficient removals of Cr(VI), bisphenol A (BPA), and combined contamination of Cr(VI) and BPA over CNTs/Bi4VO8Cl composite further confirm that the degradation of organic pollutants is a photocatalytic mechanism rather than photosensitization of dye. Of particular importance is that removal efficiency of single pollutant can be promoted by the coexistence of the Cr(VI) and organics. The mechanism of synergetic promotion is discussed and attributed to the accelerated separation of charge carriers resulted from their simultaneously being captured by pollutants. Moreover, the CNTs/Bi4VO8Cl composite exhibits good stability and recycling performance in the photocatalytic degradation process. Therefore, the composite photocatalysts developed in the present work are expected to have the potential in purification of complex wastewater. Graphical abstract The separation of photogenerated charge carriers and adsorbing capacity as well as visible light absorption ability of Bi4VO8Cl are significantly promoted by coupling with carbon nanotubes.

Bisphenol AF (BPAF),a newly introduced chemical structurally related to BPA, is used extensively. BPAF has stronger estrogenic activities than BPA. However, the potential neurotoxicological effects of BPAF are still elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the potential effects of maternal BPAF exposure during pregnancy on emotional behaviors of adolescent mice offspring. In male adolescent offspring, maternal exposure to BPAF (0.4, 4.0 mg kg(-1), intragastrically administration) induced significant anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, assessed by open field test (OFT), novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSF), sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). In female adolescent offspring, BPAF exposure at 0.4 mg kg(-1) dose reduced the latency to feeding in the NSF test, while increased the floating time in the FST. Maternal BPAF exposure decreased the recognition index in the long term memory (LTM) test in both sexes, while only decreased the freezing time of male offspring in the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task. These results indicate that maternal exposure to BPAF significantly affect emotion-related behaviors in adolescent mice offspring, and the male offspring with a higher probability to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression and to suffer memory impairment after maternal exposure to BPAF."

Initially, the titanium-based nanomagnetic particles (Fe3O4/SiO2/TiO2 NPs) were successfully synthesized and subsequently characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry. Two cationic surfactants were then incorporated into the particles to form a new sorbent for enhancing the extraction of BPA through micelle formation. Once the analyte was extracted, it was desorbed from the sorbent and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography with ultra violet detection (HPLC-UV). Various factors affecting the extraction and desorption of the analyte were investigated in detail and the optimum conditions established. Under these established conditions, the calibration curve was linear over the concentration range of 1-500ng/mL. The limit of detection was determined to be 0.5ng/mL based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)=3. To test the extraction efficiency, the method was applied to various real water samples that were spiked. The average recoveries obtained from the spiked samples ranged between 92-105% with relative standard deviations of 3.2-7.8%.

The other four parabens were determined at considerably lower concentrations than MP at levels not exceeding 100 ng L(-1) with PP found at the highest and BzP at the lowest levels. BPA was determined at similar concentration level to parabens - between 5 ng L(-1) and 95 ng L(-1) and CP was found only in a limited number of samples. Noticeable seasonal changes of paraben concentrations were found showing that for these compounds the pollutant release factor dominates both the biodegradation factor and the water volume factor. These seasonal changes were not observed for BPA and CP. Out of all determined parabens only MP was found at considerably higher concentrations than BPA. However, MP's endocrine properties are much lower than those of BPA posing a lower environmental impact potential than BPA. Influence of other (more endocrine disrupting) parabens is also relatively weak in comparison to BPA due to their considerably lower concentrations in the environment."

BPA increased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in granulosa cells; however, BPA prevented the basal and the FSH-induced progesterone production. BPA caused sequestration of cholesterol to the perinuclear area, as evident by the Filipin staining. BPA decreased mRNA expression of ATP binding cassette transporter-A1 (Abca1) and increased level of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1. Addition of exogenous cell-permeable cholesterol restored the effect of BPA on Abca1 and Star mRNA expression and partially reversed BPA's effect on progesterone production.

Previous mechanistic studies were mainly focused on their genomic activities on nuclear estrogen receptor pathway. However, their non-genomic effects through G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) pathway remain poorly understood.

Molecular docking also demonstrated the binding of these BPA analogues to GPER. By measuring calcium mobilization and cAMP production in SKBR3 cells, we found the binding of these BPA analogues to GPER lead to the activation of subsequent signaling pathways. Consistent with the binding results, BPAF and BPB presented higher agonistic activity than BPA with the lowest effective concentration (LOEC) of 10 nM. Moreover, based on the results of Boyden chamber and wound-healing assays, BPAF and BPB displayed higher activity in promoting GPER mediated SKBR3 cell migration than BPA with the LOEC of 100 nM.

We determined total BPA concentrations (TBC) in paired serum and urine samples, and urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) in urine samples collected from PTC patients, NG patients, and healthy individuals, then compared BPA concentrations and UIC within and between each patient group. The results showed that there were no gender-specific differences in serum TBC and UIC in each group, and no differences across all patient groups. Urinary BPA concentrations (UBC) were higher in the NG and PTC groups compared with the control group. UBC showed gender-specific differences in the NG and PTC group. Furthermore, UIC were higher in the NG and PTC groups compared with the control group. Higher UBC and excessive iodine intake were risk factors for NG and PTC according to multivariate logistic regression analysis. There was a significant correlation between UBC and UIC in each group. These data suggested that higher UBC and excessive iodine intake are associated with NG and PTC. The metabolic and functional pathways between BPA and iodine are potentially linked to the pathogenesis and progression of NG and PTC."
1,9,2017,Ian Kimber,Bisphenol A and immunotoxic potential: A commentary.,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacture of polycarbonate and epoxy resin plastics. There has been interest in the possibility that BPA has immunotoxic properties, and a variety of investigations have explored this. Among the approaches taken have been human observational and cross-sectional studies, investigations using experimental animals, and in vitro studies, some of which have been reviewed previously by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). This commentary aims to provide a focused review of data regarding the ability of BPA to perturb the immune system, including the developing immune system, and to cause related adverse health effects. The objective is to complement the evaluations conducted by EFSA, with a focus on the ability of BPA to impair immune function, to promote respiratory allergy and airway inflammation, and to compromise immunological tolerance to dietary proteins. The conclusion drawn is that there is currently no persuasive evidence that BPA has significant immunotoxic potential. This is, in part, due to some of the data reviewed being apparently contradictory or inconsistent, and the investigations from which those data were derived having limitations with regard to experimental design. The conclusion drawn here is that presently there is no clear evidence that BPA has the potential to cause immunotoxicity resulting in adverse health effects."

Toxicokinetic analysis revealed that systemic exposure to BPA was greater at early age (e.g., 210-fold in Cmax, and 26-fold in AUC at 50 mg/kg in male on day 1 over day 90) and in females (e.g., 4-fold in Cmax and 1.6-fold in AUC at 50 mg/kg vs. male on day 1), which might have stemmed from either age- or gender-dependent differences in metabolic capacity. These results may serve as evidence for the association between risk of cancer and exposure to low-dose BPA, especially in young children, as well as for varying toxicity of xenobiotics in different age and gender groups."

A,"In this study, the hybrid material 3-n-propyl(3-methylpyridinium) silsesquioxane chloride (Si3Py(+)Cl(-)) was synthesized and investigated as a novel sorbent phase for the disposable pipette extraction (DPX) technique coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography-florescence detection. This sorbent phase was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Aqueous samples containing the phenolic endocrine-disrupting compounds bisphenol A (BPA), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), 4-octylphenol (4-OP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) were subjected to DPX procedures and a series of optimizations was performed to determine the ideal extraction conditions using this approach. The proposed sorbent phase exhibited higher extraction efficiency than DPX-RP (reversed phase tips containing styrene-divinylbenzene), commonly used for the determination of the phenolic endocrine- disrupting-compounds under study. Satisfactory analytical performance was achieved with linear ranges from 2 to 100μgL(-1) for 4-t-OP and 1-100μgL(-1) for the other analytes. Limits of detection of 0.60μgL(-1) for 4-t-OP and 0.30μgL(-1) for other analytes, RSDs ranging from 1 to 20% and relative recoveries of 83-116% were obtained. Based on these satisfactory results, this sorbent phase represents a valuable alternative for the extraction of compounds with polar moieties in their structure."

Adult zebrafish were exposed semi-statically to media containing commonly detected estrogenic water contaminants (EE2, DES and BPA) at a concentration (5ng/L) much lower than environmentally recorded levels. Time spent in swimming, surface preference, patterns and path of swimming were recorded (6mins) for each fish using two video cameras on day 15, 30 60 and 75. Video clips were analysed using a software program. Results indicate that chronic exposure to EE leads to increased body weight and size of females, reduced (P<0.05) swimming time, delay in latency, increased (P<0.05) immobility, erratic movements and freezing episodes. We conclude that estrogenic contamination of natural aquatic systems induces alterations in locomotor behaviour and associated physiological disturbances in inhabitant fish fauna."

The aim of the present study is to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of crocin, a constituent of saffron, against BPA-induced liver toxicity. We showed that treatment of male Wistar rats with 0.5 mg/kg BPA for 30 days increased the level of 8-isoprostane, decreased the level of reduced glutathione, elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, triglyceride, and glucose, and induced periportal inflammation. Western blot results revealed that BPA increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK), but not p38. BPA also reduced the Akt signaling activation and upregulated microRNA (miR-122) expression. Moreover, we showed here that crocin 20 mg/kg administration ameliorated liver damage and improved elevated levels of TG and liver enzymes of BPA-treated rats possibly though antioxidant activity, downregulation of miR-122 transcript level and lowering the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and MAPKAPK and subsequently their activities. Overall, the findings suggest that crocin possesses hepatoprotective effects against BPA-induced liver toxicity by enhancing the antioxidative defense system and regulation of important signaling pathway activities and miR-122 expression."

The difference in the structure and surface properties of modified vermiculites were investigated using a series of characterization methods. BS and SB surfactant mainly adsorbed on the surface and hard to intercalate into the interlayer of VER, while both adsorption and intercalation occurred in PBS modification. This difference resulted in different packing density of surfactant and hydrophobicity according to the results of contact angle, and affect the adsorption capacities ultimately. The adsorption of two pollutants onto these modified vermiculites were very fast and well fitted with pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm. PBS-VER exhibited the highest adsorption capacity (92.67 and 88.87 mg g(-1) for BPA and TBBPA, respectively) than other two modified vermiculites in this order PBS-VER > BS-VER > SB-VER. The ionic strength (Na(+), Ca(2+)) and coexisting compounds (Pb(2+), humic acid) have different effects on the adsorption. PBS-VER had a good reusability and could remove ionic (methylene blue and orange G) and molecular (BPA) pollutants simultaneously and effectively due to the function of amphoteric hydrophilic groups and alkyl chains. The results might provide novel information for developing low-cost and effective adsorbents for removal of neutral and charged organic pollutants."

The morphology, structure and composition of the nanocomposites were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction patterns, Fourier transform infrared and specific surface area. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra indicated that the incorporation of C60 expanded the absorption of ZnAlTi-LDO to visible-light region. The photo-degradation experiment was conducted by using a series of C60 modified ZnAlTi-LDO with different C60 weight percentage to degrade Bisphenol A (BPA) under simulated visible light irradiation. In this experiment, the degradation rate of C60 modified ZnAlTi-LDO in photo-degradation of BPA under simulated visible light irradiation was over 80%. The intermediates formed in the degradation of BPA process by using LDO/C60-5% were 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propanol, 4-isopropenylphenol and Phenol. Photogenerated holes, superoxide radical species, *OH and singlet oxygen were considered to be responsible for the photodegradation process, among which superoxide radical species and *OH played a predominant role in the photocatalytic reaction system. C60 modified ZnAlTi-LDO catalysts for photocatalytic reduction shows great potential in degradation of organic pollutants and environmental remediation."

Much research has been carried out on adsorbed pollutants on plastic pieces and hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) associated with microplastics. However, only a few studies have focused on plastic additives. These chemicals are incorporated into plastics from which they can leach out as most of them are not chemically bound. As a consequence of plastic accumulation and fragmentation in oceans, plastic additives could represent an increasing ecotoxicological risk for marine organisms. The present work reviewed the main class of plastic additives identified in the literature, their occurrence in the marine environment, as well as their effects on and transfers to marine organisms. This work identified polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), phthalates, nonylphenols (NP), bisphenol A (BPA) and antioxidants as the most common plastic additives found in marine environments. Moreover, transfer of these plastic additives to marine organisms has been demonstrated both in laboratory and field studies. Upcoming research focusing on the toxicity of microplastics should include these plastic additives as potential hazards for marine organisms, and a greater focus on the transport and fate of plastic additives is now required considering that these chemicals may easily leach out from plastics."

BPA has been reported in thermal paper in concentrations up to 42,600 μg g(-1). The exposure to BPA via dermal transfer has been recently discussed as a significant contribution to the overall human exposure and the estimated daily intake (EDI) has been reported up to 218 μg d(-1). BPA has been also detected in recycled paper with concentrations up to 46 μg g(-1). Due to the fact that BPA is a known endocrine disruptor and migrates from materials, regulatory restrictions have been established to prevent risks for the human health. As a consequence, structural analogues, such as bisphenol S (BPS) have been introduced into the market. Little is known about the presence and toxicity of these emerging replacements, and concern has risen about them. The present review gives an overview of the occurrence and levels of BPA and replacements in thermal paper. BPA is still the most common color developer found in thermal paper, followed by BPS. The analytical methods used for quantification of BPA and BPA replacements in paper products are also reviewed. BPA is transferred from thermal paper products to the finger pads upon handling it. Paper-skin transfer followed by penetration of BPA depends on conditions (e.g. greasiness of fingers and use of hand cream). It is, however, still debated whether thermal paper as a source for human exposure contributes significantly to the overall internal BPA exposure."

The relevance of the exposure schemes used in experimental in vivo studies is also a major source of uncertainty when analysing the risk of BPA exposure for human health. In this context, the goals of our study, conducted in an ovine model relevant to human gestation and thyroid physiologies, were to: 1) determine the equivalence of subcutaneous and dietary exposures and 2) determine if environmentally relevant doses of BPA can alter gestational and newborn thyroid functions. The difference between the two routes of exposure was mainly related to the overall BPA exposure and much less to the peak serum concentrations. Interestingly, BPA-GLUC (the main metabolite of BPA) internal exposure via both routes was almost identical. The decrease in thyroid hormones concentration overtime was more accentuated in ewes treated with BPA, particularly with the medium dose (50 μg/(kg.d); SC) for which the maximum BPA concentrations were predicted to be within the 1-10 ng/mL range i.e. very similar to the highest blood concentrations reported in humans. The balance between TT4 and rT3 varied differently between the vehicle and the medium dose group. The mechanisms underlying those modifications of maternal thyroid homeostasis remain to be determined. Our study did not evidence significant modification of TSH secretion or binding to serum proteins but might suggest an effect at the level of deiodinases."

Adsorption has been shown to be a critical process controlling the environmental behaviors of fluoroquinolones. Competition between ofloxacin (OFL) and naphthalene (NAP)/bisphenol A (BPA) and their adsorption on activated carbon (AC), graphite (GP), and humic acid (HA) were investigated. The suppressed adsorption of OFL was observed on AC and GP, but not on HA, by NAP or BPA. Moreover, for AC, the competition by NAP was slightly stronger than that by BPA. However, for GP, the competition with BPA was higher than that with NAP. These observations indicate that competitive adsorption of OFL with respect to NAP/BPA depends on the degree of overlap of adsorption sites, as interpreted by the following: (i) AC can provide overlapping adsorption sites for OFL, BPA, and NAP, which include non-specific adsorption sites, such as hydrophobic sites, π-π interactions, and micropore filling; (ii) π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding might be responsible for the strong competitive adsorption between BPA and OFL on GP; and (iii) OFL adsorbs on HA through specific adsorption force-electrostatic attraction, with which NAP and BPA cannot compete."

During the past two decades, many analogs of bisphenol A (BPA) have been manufactured, while their toxicity remains less studied. The aim of this study was to compare the acute toxicity of a synthesized lignin-derived BPA (LD-BP) with that of BPA in representative aquatic organisms including two algal species (Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Scenedesmus obliquus), a cladoceran species (Daphnia magna), and the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). The results revealed that the two algal species showed different responses to the two chemicals. For C. pyrenoidosa, both BPA and LD-BP stimulated growth within 48 h of exposure, except for the 50 mg L(-1) of LD-BP treatment. After 96 and 144 h of exposures, BPA stimulated the growth of C. pyrenoidosa at low-exposure concentrations but inhibited its growth at high concentrations, while LD-BP caused a concentration-dependent response in C. pyrenoidosa. S. obliquus exhibited a monotonic concentration-response curve for both BPA and LD-BP exposures. For both D. magna and O. latipes, concentration-responses were monotonic with 96 h-LC50 of BPA and LD-BP of 11.7 and 5.0 mg L(-1) and 9.4 and 4.1 mg L(-1), respectively. Our results demonstrate that LD-BP is more toxic than BPA in the representative aquatic organisms, and it can pose higher ecological risk to the aquatic ecosystem than BPA."

We also evaluated, for the first time in the oral cancer model, the radioprotective effect of histamine against mucositis in precancerous tissue as the dose-limiting tissue. Cancerized pouches were exposed to: BPA-BNCT; BPA-BNCT + histamine; BO: Beam only; BO + histamine; CONTROL: cancerized, no-treatment. BNCT induced severe mucositis, with an incidence that was slightly higher than in ""B1"" experiments (86 vs 67%, respectively). BO induced low/moderate mucositis. Histamine slightly reduced the incidence of severe mucositis induced by BPA-BNCT (75 vs 86%) and prevented mucositis altogether in BO animals. Tumor overall response was significantly higher in BNCT (94-96%) than in control (16%) and BO groups (9-38%), and did not differ significantly from the ""B1"" results (91%).

Although various synaptic mechanisms have been shown to mediate BPA-induced brain deficits, there are almost no reports addressing its underlying physiological mechanisms at the individual neuron level, particularly in the primary visual system. In the present study, using multiple-channel recording technique, we recorded the responses of single neurons in the primary visual system of cats to various direction stimuli both before and after BPA exposure. The results showed that the orientation selectivity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (area 17, A17) was obviously decreased after 2 h of intravenous BPA administration (0.2 mg/kg). Moreover, there were worse performances of information transmission of A17 neurons, presenting markedly decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To some extent, these functional decreases were attributable to the altered information inputs from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which showed an increased spontaneous activity. Additionally, local injection of BPA (3.3 μg/ml) in A17 resulted in an obvious increase in orientation selectivity and a decrease in neuronal activity, involving enhanced activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. In conclusion, our results first demonstrate that acute BPA exposure can restrict the visual perception of cats, mainly depending on the alteration of the LGN projection, not the intercortical interaction. Importantly, BPA-induced-brain deficits might not only be confined to the cortical level but also occur as early as at the subcortical level."

Once sexual maturity was reached, a mammary tumour was induced injecting 4T1 cells in situ, these cells are derived from a spontaneous adenocarcinoma in a BALB/c mouse and therefore allows for an immunocompetent recipient. After 25 days of injection, showing no major endocrine alterations, BPA-exposed mice developed larger tumours. Tumour leukocytic infiltrate analysis revealed a higher proportion of regulatory T lymphocytes in the BPA-exposed group. RT-PCR analysis of tumour samples showed a decreased expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ, as well as the M2 macrophage marker Fizz-1 in the BPA-exposed group. Flow cytometry analysis revealed differences in ERα expression by T lymphocytes, macrophages and NK cells, both associated to BPA exposure and tumour development.

Urine (0-48 h) and serum (0-7.5 h) were monitored for free and total BPA-d16. One week later, participants returned for a dietary administration with monitoring as above. One participant repeated the dermal administration with extended monitoring of urine (9 days) and serum (2 days). After dietary exposure, urine total BPA-d16 peaked within 5 h and quickly cleared within 24 h. After dermal exposure, cumulative excretion increased linearly for 2 days, and half the participants still had detectable urinary total BPA-d16 after 1 week. The participant repeating the dermal exposure had detectable BPA-d16 in urine for 9 days, showed linear cumulative excretion over 5 days, and had detectable free BPA-d16 in serum. Proportions of free BPA-d16 in urine following dermal exposure (0.71%-8.3% of total BPA-d16) were generally higher than following the dietary exposure (0.29%-1.4%).

The safety of chemical substances is adequately managed by regulations based on scientific information from toxicity tests. However, there are substances reported to have ""biological effects"" even though they are judged to be nontoxic in conventional toxicity tests. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a new concept on toxicity, ""epigenetic toxicity"". In this review, we explain about epigenetic toxicity using bisphenol A (BPA) and valproic acid (VPA) as examples. We also discuss the problems associated with the judgment of epigenetic toxicity. Currently, epigenetic changes can only be detected by biochemical methods, which are labor-intensive. Therefore, we are developing reporter mice that can be used to detect epigenetic toxicity during conventional toxicity tests. In addition, we consider that linking epigenomic changes with phenotypic changes is important, because causality is important for toxicity evaluation. Therefore, we are developing an artificial epigenome-editing technology. If we can develop a safety-assessment system by incorporating epigenetic evaluation into toxicity tests, we can increase the safety of both food and environmental chemical substances. The practical application of such a new safety-assessment system will be increasingly important in the future."

Immunohistochemistry result showed that Vtg proteins mainly deposit in spermatogonium and spermatocytes. Following 225μg/L bisphenol A (BPA) exposure 1, 3 and 9 weeks, testicular vtg mRNAs were mostly significantly decreased. The further chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that BPA could decrease estrogen receptor (Er) recruitment in vtg promoter, which possibly reduced Er's transcription activation effect on vtgs. However, different from the continuously decreased vtg mRNA levels, testicular Vtg protein levels were recovered at week 9. Considering the induced hepatic Vtg expression, testicular Vtgs may be replenished by the induced hepatic Vtgs under BPA exposure."

By visual inspection of candidate genes located on the X-chromosome, we identified a large deletion in the NSDHL gene, encoding NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like, a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The deletion spanned >14 kb, and included the last three exons of the NSDHL gene. By PCR and fragment length analysis, we confirmed the presence of the variant in both affected dogs, and its absence in 50 control Labrador Retrievers. Variants in the NSDHL gene cause CHILD syndrome in humans, and the bare patches (Bpa) and striated (Str) phenotypes in mice. Taken together, our genetic data and the known role of NSDHL in X-linked skin disorders strongly suggest that the identified structural variant in the NSDHL gene is causative for the phenotype in the two affected dogs."

Except for DMP only found in Pingshantou, all of the selected EDCs existed widely in the source water. DMP, DEP, BBP, DBP, NP, BPA, EE2, and E1 had the ranges of nd (cannot be detected)-130 ng/L, 25-310, 76-1351, 431-1299, 215-627, 23-107, nd-0.174, and 0.143-0.334 ng/L, respectively. Therefore, the studied water sources were associated with notable levels of EDCs, wherein the concentrations of BBP, DBP, and NP were much higher than the other five chemicals. The selected EDCs appeared to be higher in upstream than in downstream (p < 0.05) for each water source, suggesting that EDCs were subjected to a decreasing with water flow. Correlation analysis suggests that DEP-BP-DBP, NP-BPA, and EE2-E1 might have the same sources, respectively; and the source of NP, EE2, and E1 was different from that of BBP, BEP and BBP, and DEP, respectively. It was observed that both the TAS (total ambient severity) and RQ (risk quotient) were less than 1, indicating that EDCs in Huai River (Huainan section) posed little or no thread to the health of local inhabitants and ecological environmental."

A,"The present work presents a novel and rapid analytical method for the simultaneous analysis of bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) in edible oil based on dispersive micro solid phase extraction (DMSPE) for the first time followed by isotope dilution-ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The edible oil sample was dispersed by n-hexane and extracted with ammoniated methanol-water solution. Then the target analytes were dispersedly absorbed using the polymer anion exchange (PAX) as the sorbent and eluted by acidic methanol. After that, four bisphenols were separated on a C18 column by gradient elution with methanol and 0.05% ammonium hydroxide in water as mobile phase, detected by MS/MS under multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode and quantified by internal standard method. The PAX amounts, adsorption time, concentrations of formic acid in the elution solvent and volume of elution solvent for the DMSPE technique were optimized. The limit of detection and quantitation (LOD and LOQ), matrix effect, recovery and precision of the developed method were investigated. Results indicated that BPS and the rest three bisphenols displayed excellent linearity in the concentration ranges of 0.1-50μg/L and 0.5-250μg/L, respectively, with correlation coefficients (R(2)) all larger than 0.998. Achieved MLODs (S/N=3) varied between 0.1-0.4μg/kg for all bisphenols. The mean recoveries at three spiked levels in edible oil were in the range of 87.3-108%. Intra-day precision (n=6) and inter-day precision (n=5) were <9% and <11%, respectively. This method is of rapid-and-simple pretreatment, accurate and sensitive, and suitable for the simultaneous determination of bisphenols in edible oil."

In present study we aimed to investigate the effects of BPA on global and gene specific DNA methylation, global histone modifications and regulation of chromatin modifiying enzymes in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Cells were treated with BPA at 0.1, 1 and 10μM concentrations for 48 and 96h. IC50 value of BPA was determined as 183 and 129μM in SH-SY5Y cells after 24h by MTT and NRU tests, respectively. We observed significant alterations on the 5-mC% levels (1.3 fold) and 5-hmC% levels (1.67 fold) after 10μM of BPA for 96h. Significant decrease was identified in H3K9me3 and H3K9ac after 10μM of BPA for 96h while decrease was observed in H3K4me3 at 10μM of BPA for 48h. Alterations were observed in chromatin modifiying genes including G9a, EZH2, SETD8, SETD1A, HAT1, SIRT1, DNMT1, RIZ1 and Suv39h1 after 96h of BPA exposure.

The objective of this study was to explore the potential association between the estrogenic effect induced by bisphenol A in vivo and changes of endogenous E2 and gene specific DNA methylation levels. After a waterborne exposure of male zebrafish to 500, 1000, or 1500μg/L of BPA for 21d, vitellogenin (VTG) concentration in whole body homogenate, plasma E2 and testosterone levels, hepatic ERs mRNA expressions, gonadal cyp19a1a and cyp17a1 mRNA expressions, and methylation levels of hepatic esr1 and gonadal cyp19a1a's promoters were determined. Our results indicated that for the 500 and 1500μg/L treatment groups, VTG might be induced mainly by the elevated E2 levels; increases of E2 levels could be partly explained by the up-regulated expression of gonadal aromatase, mRNA levels of which were found to be negatively related to the methylation levels of both its promoter and one CpG site. In addition, upon BPA exposure, hepatic esr1 mRNA levels were also negatively related to the methylation levels of both its promoter and one CpG site. These observations provide evidence for the non-ERs mediated mechanisms underlying the estrogenic action of BPA on male zebrafish."

Previous in vitro studies showed that these compounds antagonize androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity; however, the mechanisms of action are unclear. In the present study, we investigated interactions of coregulator peptides with BPA, BPAF, or BPS at the AR complexes using Micro Array for Real-time Coregulator Nuclear Receptor Interaction (MARCoNI) assays and assessed the binding of these compounds on AR by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The set of coregulator peptides that are recruited by BPA-bound AR, either positively/or negatively, are different from those recruited by the agonist R1881-bound AR. Therefore, the data indicates that BPA shows no similarities to R1881 and suggests that it may recruit other coregulators to the AR complex. BPAF-bound AR recruits about 70-80% of the same coregulator peptides as BPA-bound AR. Meanwhile, BPS-bound AR interacts with only few peptides compared to BPA or BPAF-bound AR. MD results show that multiple binding sites with varying binding affinities are available on AR for BPA, BPAF, and BPS, indicating the availability of modified binding surfaces on AR for coregulator interactions. These findings help explain some of the distinct AR-related toxicities observed with bisphenol chemicals and raise concern for the use of substitutes for BPA in commercial products."

The aim of this study was to estimate the prenatal exposure to BPA and DEHP through food consumption for pregnant women living in Tarragona County (Spain). Probabilistic calculations of prenatal exposure were estimated by integrated external and internal dosimetry modelling, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Physical characteristic data from the cohort, along with food intake information from the questionnaires (concentrations of BPA and DEHP in different food categories and the range of the different food ratios), were used to estimate the value of the total dietary intake for the Tarragona pregnancy cohort. The major contributors to the total dietary intake of BPA were canned fruits and vegetables, followed by canned meat and meat products. In turn, milk and dairy products, followed by ready to eat food (including canned dinners), were the most important contributors to the total dietary intake of DEHP. Despite the dietary variations among the participants, the intakes of both chemicals were considerably lower than their respective current tolerable daily intake (TDI) values established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Internal dosimetry estimates suggest that the plasma concentrations of free BPA and the most important DEHP metabolite, mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), in pregnant women were characterized by transient peaks (associated with meals) and short half-lives (< 2h). In contrast, fetal exposure was characterized by a low and sustained basal BPA and MEHP concentration due to a lack of metabolic activity in the fetus. Therefore, EDs may have a greater effect on developing organs in young children or in the unborn child."

One area of research focus has been the role of BPA exposure in promoting the development of ovarian cancer; however, the doses used in most of previous studies are relatively high and most likely exceed physiologically relevant levels. At the same time, few studies have described potential mechanisms underlying the link between BPA and increased cancer risk. To address these concerns we investigated the mechanism(s) by which low concentrations of BPA promote proliferation and energy metabolism in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3. We found that even sub-toxic BPA concentrations not only drove increased OVCAR-3 cell proliferation but also promoted glycolysis-based metabolism, as evidenced by elevated cell viability, accelerated cell proliferation, increased levels of intracellular ATP, lactate, and pyruvic acid. Importantly, all of these effects were estrogen receptor α (ERα) dependent, as siRNA-mediated ERα silencing decreased BPA-induced proliferation, pinpointing the crucial role of ERα-conducted signaling in BPA-induced biological effects. Together, our findings revealed a new mechanism through which BPA promoted cell proliferation by reinforcing glycolysis-based energy production dependent on ER signaling. This study would thus open a new path to understand BPA-induced biological effects on tumor cells."

Even though several in vivo and in vitro studies showed positive associations of BPA exposure with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-6, the mechanism by which BPA induces inflammation is unclear. We investigated the mechanism by which BPA induces inflammation (expression of inflammation-related genes, changes in oxidative stress, and cell proliferation and migration) and evaluated the effect of BPA exposure on inflammation-related markers in epidemiologic studies using repeat urine and serum samples from elderly subjects. BPA induced COX-2 expression via nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and enhanced the migration of lung cancer A549 and breast cancer MDAMB-231 cells. In two epidemiologic studies, we detected associations of BPA with six inflammation-related markers (WBC, CRP, IL-10, ALT, AST, and γ-GTP levels). Our findings probably suggest that BPA exposure induces inflammation and exacerbates tumorigenesis."

We examined two steroidogenic enzymes, CYP11A1 and CYP19 that involved in sex hormone synthesis in mouse MA-10 Leydig cells. We found that BPA activated CYP gene in both mRNA and protein levels then resulted in alteration of the normal sex hormone ratio.

Time-course of precursor compounds and formation of transformation products (TPs) were investigated by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). Nitrate showed a positive effect in the removal of selected pollutants. Observed TPs resulted from hydroxylation, aromatic nitration (with or without molecule cleavage) and nitro dehalogenation processes. The above reactions involved the participation of *OH and *NO2 radicals arising from photolysis of nitrate. Nitro TPs were produced in a different extent depending on the structure of the precursor pollutant, nitrate concentration, light source (254 nm UV and solar light) and water matrix (ultrapure, surface and urban wastewater). Some of these nitro TPs were also observed during UV irradiation of untreated and unbuffered wastewater, either naturally polluted with parent phenolic compounds or spiked with these species at the sub μg L(-1) level. Nitration reactions were particularly favourable for OPP with the generated nitro TPs displaying a higher stability than the precursor molecule and the hydroxylated TPs of the same compound."

However, many association studies have often failed to consider multiple chemicals with possible common sources of exposure, rendering their conclusions less reliable. In the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the U.S.A., urinary levels of environmental phenols, parabens, and phthalate metabolites as well as serum thyroid hormones were measured in a general U.S. population (≥12years old, n=1829). Employing these data, first, the chemicals or their metabolites associated with thyroid hormone measures were identified. Then, the chemicals/metabolites with possible common exposure sources were included in the analytical model to test the sensitivities of their association with thyroid hormone levels. Benzophenone-3 (BP-3), bisphenol A (BPA), and a metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were identified as significant determinants of decreased serum thyroid hormones. However, significant positive correlations were detected (p-value<0.05, r=0.23 to 0.45) between these chemicals/metabolites, which suggests that they might share similar exposure sources. In the subsequent sensitivity analysis, which included the chemicals/metabolite with potentially similar exposure sources in the model, we found that urinary BP-3 and DEHP exposure were associated with decreased thyroid hormones among the general population but BPA exposure was not. In association studies, the presence of possible common exposure sources should be considered to circumvent possible false-positive conclusions."

Given that Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous compound in maternal diet, may disrupt brain development and behavior, we hypothesized that paternal BPA diet (PBD) could affect offspring development. Prefrontal cortex (PFC), a vital brain region, is involved in emotion and social behavior. To test whether PBD could alter developing PFC, we carried out a proteomics approach for PFC in male juvenile offspring that responded to PBD (50 mg BPA/kg diet). We found that PBD altered the expressions of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), CCAAT/-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), which could reflect endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, downregulation of myelinogenesis genes and myelin basic protein (MBP) could provoke myelin deficiency. Furthermore, PBD significantly increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired social behavior in male offspring. Taken together, these results revealed the alterations of ER stress and myelin destruction related molecules induced by PBD might be a potential mechanism for the behavior deficits in their male offspring. These findings remind us of the importance of paternal effects in the further environmental exposure research."

Because there are many industries and living areas around Taihu Lake, the total concentrations of ∑BPs were much higher than that in Luoma Lake, which is away from the industry-intensive areas. For the two lakes, BPA was still the dominant BPs in both surface water and sediment, followed by BPF and BPS. The spatial distribution and principal component analysis showed that BPs in Luoma Lake was relatively homogeneous and the potential sources were relatively simple than that in Taihu Lake. The spatial distribution of BPs in sediment of Taihu Lake indicated that ∑BPs positively correlated with the TOC content.

BPA is known to cause adverse effects in living organisms including plants. Several studies reported that BPA affects growth and development in plants, mainly through oxidative stress. Plants are known to generally cope with stress mainly through hormonal regulation and adaptation, but little is known about the role of plant hormones in plants under BPA stress. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of ethylene in BPA induced oxidative stress in plants using Arabidopsis thaliana as a test plant. The response of ethylene insensitive mutants of Arabidopsis (ein2-1 and etr1-3) to BPA exposure was studied in comparison to the wild type Arabidopsis (WT). In all three genotypes, exposure to BPA adversely affected cellular structures, stomata and light-harvesting pigments. An increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) lipid peroxidation and other oxidative stress markers indicated that BPA induced toxicity through oxidative stress. However, the overall results revealed that WT Arabidopsis had more pronounced BPA induced damages while ein2-1 and etr1-3 mutants withstood the BPA induced stress more efficiently. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of antioxidants related genes revealed that the antioxidant defense system in both mutants was more efficiently activated than in WT against BPA induced oxidative stress, which further evidenced the involvement of ethylene in regulating BPA induced oxidative stress. It is concluded that ethylene perception and signaling may be involved in BPA induced oxidative stress responses in plants."

In this study, the mechanisms of humic acid (HA) affecting the photocatalytic performance of nano-TiO2 were elucidated by using three HA fractions from the same source but with different polarities. Bulk HA was fractionated on a silica gel column to get three fractions with polarity increasing in the order of FA, FB and FC. FA was fulvic acid-like while FB and FC were humic acid-like. All the three fractions (at 0.1 mg/L) promoted the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OHs) by nano-TiO2, and thus in turn facilitated the photocatalytic degradation of bispheol A (BPA). FA and FC displayed a stronger promotion effect than FB and the bulk HA. Online in situ flow cell ATR-FTIR and XPS analyses indicated that HA fractions could form charge-transfer complex with nano-TiO2 surface through the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic groups, which favored the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Through step methylation experiments, it was verified that the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of HA fractions played important roles in promoting the photocatalytic performance of nano-TiO2, and the effect of carboxylic group was more significant than the phenolic hydroxyl group."

Although the incorporation of SWCNT, GRA or their combination (SWCNT+GRA) did not break up the complexes composed of manganese peroxidase (MnP) and these substrates, they had different effects on the native contacts between the substrates and MnP. GRA tended to decrease the overall stability of the binding between MnP and its substrates. SWCNT or SWCNT+GRA generally had a minor impact on the mean binding energy between MnP and its substrates. We detected some sensitive residues from MnP that were dramatically disturbed by the GRA, SWCNT or SWCNT+GRA. Nanomaterials changed the number and behavior of water molecules adjacent to both MnP and its substrates, which was not due to the destruction of H-bond network formed by sensitive regions and water molecules.

Under aerobic conditions, BPA was quickly depleted as a result of bioaugmentation with Bacillus sp. GZB in water-sediment contaminated with pollutants. The pollutants used were generally associated with the electronic wastes (mobile phones, computers, televisions) dismantling process. Adding BPA affected the bacterial community composition in the water-sediment. Furthermore, BPA biodegradation was enhanced by adding electron donors/co-substrates: humic acid, NaCl, glucose, and yeast extract.

We examined brain cell damage and the effects of learning and memory ability after BPA exposure in male mice (4 weeks of age) that were divided into four groups and chronically received different BPA treatments for 8 weeks. The comet assay and hippocampal neuron counting were used to detect the brain cell damage. The Y-maze test was applied to test alterations in learning and memory ability. Long term potentiation induction by BPA exposure was performed to study the potential mechanism of performance. The percentages of tail DNA, tail length and tail moment in brain cells increased with increasing BPA exposure concentrations. Significant differences in DNA damage were observed among the groups, including between the low-dose and control groups. In the Y-maze test, the other three groups qualified for the learned standard one day earlier than the high-exposed group. Furthermore, the ratio of qualified mice in the high-exposed group was always the lowest among the groups, indicating that high BPA treatment significantly altered the spatial memory performance of mice. Different BPA treatments exerted different effects on the neuron numbers of different regions in the hippocampus. In the CA1 region, the high-exposed group had a significant decrease in neuron numbers. A non-monotonic relationship was observed between the exposure concentrations and neuron quantity in the CA3 region. The hippocampal slices in the control and medium-exposed groups generated long-term potentiation after induction by theta burst stimulation, but the low-exposed group did not. A significant difference was observed between the control and low-exposed groups. In conclusion, chronic exposure to a low level of BPA had adverse effects on brain cells and altered the learning and memory ability of adolescent mice."

This exposes most people in developed countries through ingestion, skin absorption and inhalation. Two ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) can interact in disrupting blastocyst implantation in inseminated females. We hypothesized that DEHP might increase the bioavailability of BPA in tissues by competing for metabolic enzymes. We injected 0, 3, 9 or 18 mg DEHP into female and male mice and allowed 30 min for the chemical to circulate before giving them a food supplement containing 50 μg kg(-1 14) C-BPA. Animals were dissected 1 h following (14) C-BPA administration and various tissue samples were acquired. Samples were solubilized and radioactivity was measured via liquid scintillation counting. In cycling females, DEHP increased BPA deposition in the muscle, uterus, ovaries and blood serum relative to controls. In peri-implantation females, DEHP increased deposition of BPA in the uterus, ovaries and serum relative to controls. In males, DEHP doses increased BPA deposition in serum and epididymis relative to controls. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that DEHP competes with BPA for conjugating enzymes such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, thereby magnifying the presence of BPA in estrogen-binding reproductive tissues.

Mn(2+)-enriched cultures exhibited the highest BPA removal efficiency (∼78%), while controls only reached about 27%. BioMnOx may significantly promote BPA oxidation in algae culture, enhancing the accumulation of substrates for glycosylation. Moreover, continuous BioMnOx increase and Mn(2+) decrease during BPA oxidation confirmed Mn oxide regeneration. In conclusion, Mn oxide formation by microalgae has the potential to be used for environmental remediation."
15,10,2017,"Etiënne L M Vermeirssen, Conrad Dietschweiler, Inge Werner, Michael Burkhardt",Corrosion protection products as a source of bisphenol A and toxicity to the aquatic environment.,Water research,"Steel components are typically treated with anti-corrosion coatings like epoxy or polyurethane resins to protect the integrity and functioning of steel. Such resins may contain substances, such as bisphenol A (BPA), that have caused concern in a human and environmental toxicological context. We investigated the release of toxicity from four anti-corrosion coatings used in hydraulic and civil engineering. Resins were applied onto glass plates and leachate samples produced by horizontally shaking the plates in water for 7 days. Two experiments were conducted, one with a 1 day and one with a 7 day curing period. Using a suite of bioassays, we tested samples for: agonistic and antagonistic effects on various mammalian nuclear receptors; inhibition of photosynthesis and growth in algae; inhibition of bacterial bioluminescence; and inhibition of water flea reproduction. Concentrations of BPA, bisphenol F and various BPA transformation products were determined by chemical analysis (LC-MS/MS). Bioassay results were evaluated using a scheme developed by DIBt (Centre of Competence for Construction, Berlin, Germany). Three products induced responses in one or more of the measured endpoints and toxicity profiles varied markedly in intensity across products. One product released high amounts of BPA which was associated with effects on nuclear receptor transactivation, requiring a more than 700-fold dilution for effect induction to fall below 20%. The same product was also the most toxic to water flea reproduction, requiring ca. 70-fold dilution for effects to fall below 20%. Another product was highly toxic in terms of bacterial bioluminescence, particularly after a shorter curing time, requiring a ca. 1'300-fold dilution for effects to fall below 20%. The third product required a 22-fold dilution for inhibition of water flea reproduction to drop below 20%. Results show that anti-corrosion coatings based on epoxy resins can be a source of toxicity to the aquatic environment. The fact that some products are more toxic than others highlights opportunities for the development of low risk formulations and products with better environmental performance. Finally, the DIBt scheme provides a useful starting point to develop further ecotoxicity guidelines for testing and data evaluation of leachates from construction materials."

Water samples were prepared at room temperature or at 40°C for three months to verify the storage effect on the coatings. Solid phase extraction was used to concentrate and to extract coating substances. Hormonal activities were checked in vitro using reporter gene bioassays. Except BBF, all extracts induced a weak but significant estrogenic agonist activity in the human cell line. Using an estrogenic antagonist (ICI-182, 780), the answer was demonstrated specific in the bioassay. RR was the only extract to induce a concentration dependent anti-androgenic response in the MDA-KB2 cell line. Analysis performed using GC-MS and HPLC-MS detected 12 substances in most of the extracts. 8 NIAS were present. Among them, 4 were identified with certainty: HMBT, BGA, DCU and BPA. Estrogenic potency was BPA>DCU>BGA>HMBT. HMBT was also anti-androgenic at high concentration. Combining chemical analysis and bioassays data, we demonstrated that in the RR and the RR40 extracts, the observed estrogenic response was mainly due to BPA, the anti-androgenic activity of RR could be due to a synergism between HMBT and BPA. For MC and AA, estrogenic responses appear to be due to the presence of DCU. Except BBF, storage conditions tended to increase estrogenic activities in all extracts. However, in term of risk assessment, activities observed were negligible. This work demonstrated that sensitive bioassays are pertinent tools in complement to chemical analysis to monitor and check the presence of NIAS with hormonal activity in coating extracts."

As compared with conventional organic fluorogens, the probes with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) characteristics show significant advantages in high quantum yield at concentrated and aggregated state, large Stokes shift and low cytotoxicity. However, the synthesis of AIE-active fluorescent probes through the ESIPT mechanism has received only very limited attention. On the other hand, the preparation of biodegradable fluorescent probes through the ESIPT mechanism has not been demonstrated thus far. In this work, we reported for the first time that water dispersible and biodegradable fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles with AIE and ESIPT characteristics could be facilely obtained through conjugation of 2,4-Dihydroxybenzophenone based benzophenone azine (BPA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) using hexamethylene diisocyanate. The final copolymers contained hydrophilic and biocompatible PEG and biodegradable urethane linkage are readily self-assembled into core-shell nanostructures. Moreover, the self-assembled BPA-PEG2000 fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) displayed obvious AIE feature, high water dispersibility, superb biocompatibility, biodegradability and excellent cell dyeing performance. All of the above properties implied that BPA-PEG2000 FONs are promising candidates for a variety of biomedical applications."

Since all analytes possess the phenolic group, dansyl chloride derivatization was applied in order to gain high sensitivity. The method was validated according to FDA guidelines, and all validation requirements were satisfactory. The lower limits of quantifications were 41.6, 54.9, 43.5 and 150.8pg/mL for BPA, BPS, BPF and BPAF; 172, 149, 171, 134 and 202pg/mL for methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl- and benzyl-paraben; 10.5, 6.7 and 9.4pg/mL for estrone, estradiol and estriol, respectively. This is the first method allowing the determination of plasma bisphenols, parabens and estrogens in one run, and also the first determination of BPF levels in human plasma. The method was used to examine the plasma levels of healthy normospermic men, where three times higher plasma levels of BPF than BPA were found."

One example is Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrinic disruptor, which is widely used in plastic production. Due to its endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic (micro-)organisms and its ubiquity, in surface- and wastewater alike, adequate treatment techniques are necessary. In this study, the degradation of BPA by a sonoelectrochemical hybrid system was investigated, using a low frequency (24kHz) ultrasound horn and two boron doped diamond electrodes. It was found that by the combination of the individual processes, i.e. ultrasound and electrochemical oxidation, more than 90% of BPA could be removed within 30min at an initial concentration of 1mgL(-1). Moreover, synergistic effects were discovered and a considerable improvement compared to the individual processes could be achieved by using a potential of 5V, whereas synergistic effects were absent at a potential of 10V. This study provides investigation of ultrasound amplitude, potential and electrode positioning on BPA degradation. The reaction was found to follow pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.089min(-1). Samples were analysed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a diode array detector. Moreover, the presence and distribution of hydroxyl radicals within the reactor was visualized by using sonochemiluminescence."

Photosynthesis supplies the substances and energy required for plant growth, and regulated by stomatal and non-stomatal factors. Therefore, in this study, to reveal how BPA affects photosynthesis in soybean seedlings (Glycine max L.) from the perspective of stomatal and non-stomatal factors, the stomatal factors (stomatal conductance and behaviours) and non-stomatal factors (Hill reaction, apparent quantum efficiency, Rubisco activity, carboxylation efficiency, the maximum Rubisco carboxylation velocity, ribulose-1,5-bisphospate regeneration capacities mediated by maximum electron transport rates, and triose phosphate utilization rate) were investigated using a portable photosynthesis system. Moreover, the pollution of BPA in the environment was simulated. The results indicate that low-dose BPA enhanced net photosynthetic rate (Pn) primarily by promoting stomatal factors, resulting in increased relative growth rates and accelerated soybean seedling growth. High-dose BPA decreases the Pn by simultaneously inhibiting stomatal and non-stomatal factors, and this inhibition decreases the relative growth rates further reducing soybean seedling growth. Following the withdrawal of BPA, all of the indices were restored to varying degrees. In conclusion, low-dose BPA increased the Pn by promoting stomatal factors while high-dose BPA decreased the Pn by simultaneously inhibiting stomatal and non-stomatal factors. These findings provide a model (or, hypothesis) for the effects of BPA on plant photosynthesis."

The photocatalyst was characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Small area electron diffraction (SAED), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy (FTIR), Photoluminescence (PL), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), UV-vis spectrophotometry and Brauner Emmet Teller surface area analyzer (BET). We achieve a Z-scheme photocatalyst (ZnSe-WO3) with a higher charge flow and visible absorption. Gum ghatti acts as a superadsorbent and a sink for charge carriers. The removal of BPA has been studied under three experimental protocols where 99.5% removal was achieved by symbiose of photocatalysis-adsorption-ozonation in just 45min hetero-assembly has a high surface area, stability and reduced carrier recombination. The results have been analyzed by scavenger effect, mass spectrometry, kinetics and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. 49.4% of TOC was removed and COD was reduced to 16.7% after 2h in symbiotic condition. From the band edges and scavenger effect it was inferred that superoxide radical anions are major attacking species.

Trisodium citrate was introduced to keep the Bi microspheres from oxidation, the high purity in composition are beneficial to eliminate the influence of bismuth oxides. Photocatalytic properties of the hierarchical Bi microspheres were investigated under visible-light irradiation by taking the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) dye and colorless bisphenol A (BPA) as probe reactions. 99.7% of RhB and 47.4% of BPA degradation in 3h indicate good photocatalytic property of the hierarchical Bi microspheres. Results of storing detection and recycled experiments revealed good structure stability and photocatalytic stability of the Bi microspheres, these properties are vital for practical applications of the materials.

Whereas epidemiological data implicate environmental factors in the increasing incidence of T1D, their identity remains unknown. Though exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with several disorders, no epidemiologic evidence has linked BPA exposure and T1D. The goal of this study was to elucidate diabetogenic potentials of BPA and underlying mechanisms in the context of T-cell immunity, in a multiple low-dose streptozotocin (MLDSTZ)-induced autoimmune mouse T1D model. C57BL/6 mice were orally exposed to 1 or 10 mg BPA/L starting at 4 wk of age; diabetes was induced at 9 wk of age with STZ. T-cell composition, function, and insulitis levels were studied at Days 11 and 50 during diabetes development (i.e. post-first STZ injection). Results showed both BPA doses increased diabetes incidence and affected T-cell immunity. However, mechanisms of diabetogenic action appeared divergent based on dose. Low-dose BPA fits a profile of an agent that exhibits pro-diabetogenic effects via T-cell immunomodulation in the early stages of disease development, i.e. decreases in splenic T-cell subpopulations [especially CD4(+) T-cells] along with a trend in elevation of splenic T-cell formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6). In contrast, high-dose BPA did not affect T-cell populations and led to decreased levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Both treatments did not affect insulitis levels at the disease early stage, but aggravated it later on. By the study end, besides decreasing T-cell proliferative capacity, low-dose BPA did not affect other T-cell-related parameters, including cytokine secretion, comparable to the effects of high-dose BPA. In conclusion, this study confirmed BPA as a potential diabetogenic compound with immunomodulatory mechanisms of action - in the context of T-cell immunity - that seemed to be dose dependent in the early immunopathogenesis of a MLDSTZ-induced model of T1D."

The present study involved controlled hydroponic experiments to assess uptake and elimination rate constants (ku, ke), bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and translocation factors (TFs) of several PhACs and EDCs in two aquatic macrophyte species, including one submerged species (Echinodorus horemanii) and one free-floating species (Eichhornia crassipes). The results revealed that the studied compounds are readily taken up in these aquatic plants. While bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and translocation factors (TFs) of the test compounds varied substantially, no discernible relationship with physicochemical properties such as octanol-water distribution coefficient (Dow), membrane-water distribution coefficient (Dmw) and organic carbon-water partition coefficient (Koc). Diphenhydramine and triclosan exhibited the highest degree of uptake and bioaccumulation potential. For example, the whole-plant BCF of triclosan in E. horemanii was 4390L/kg, while the whole-plant BCF of diphenhydramine in E. crassipes was 6130L/kg. BCFs of 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), estrone (E1) and bisphenol A (BPA) were relatively low (2-150L/kg). BCFs were generally higher in free-floating aquatic macrophyte species compared to the submerged species. For the free-floating species, E. crassipes, the majority of PhACs and EDCs were more allocated in roots compared to leaves, with TFs<1. However, some compounds such as caffeine, atrazine, diphenhydramine, E2 and carbamazepine were more allocated in leaf tissue (TFs>1). The study findings may be useful for design and implementation of phytoremediation systems, as well as aid future modeling and risk assessment initiatives for these emerging organic contaminants."

Screening and potential toxicity.",The Science of the total environment,"Thermal paper contains potentially toxic additives, such as bisphenol A (BPA), as a common color developer. Because of its known endocrine disrupting effects, structural analogues to BPA, such as bisphenol S (BPS), D-8 and Pergafast 201, have been used as alternatives, but little is known about the presence and toxicological effects of alternatives other than BPS. In this study, thermal paper is screened by direct probe ambient mass spectrometry (rapid pre-screening method not requiring sample preparation) and by liquid chromatography (LC) with high resolution time-of flight (TOF-MS) mass spectrometry. Cash receipts and other thermal paper products (cinema tickets, boarding passes and luggage tags) were analyzed. Besides BPA and BPS, other developers only recently reported (Pergafast 201, D-8) or to the best of our knowledge not reported before (D-90, TGSA, BPS-MAE) were frequently found as well as some related unreported impurities (2,4-BPS that is a BPS related impurity and a TGSA related impurity). To gain some insight into the potential estrogenicity of the detected developers, a selection of extracts was further analyzed using a LC-nanofractionation platform in combination with cell-based bioassay testing. These preliminary results seems to indicate very low or absence of estrogenic activity for Pergafast 201, D-8, D-90, TGSA and BPS-MAE in comparison to BPA and BPS, although further dose-response tests with authentic standards are required to confirm these results. Compounds for which standards were available were also tested for developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. TGSA and D-8 induced similar teratogenic effects as BPA in zebrafish embryos. BPS and 2,4-BPS did not induce any developmental effects but 2,4-BPS did alter the locomotor activity at the tested concentration. Our findings suggest that the alternatives used as alternatives to BPA (except BPS) might not be estrogenic. However, TGSA and D-8 showed abnormal developmental effects similar to BPA."

However, there is limited understanding of the spatial distribution, potential sources and risk assessment for those bisphenol analogues. In this study, seven bisphenol analogues were investigated in water and sediment samples from Taihu Lake, China. Compared to the same lake in 2013 (range: 5.4-87ng/L for waters and 0.37-8.3ng/g dw for sediments), the samples from Taihu Lake contained comparatively higher BPs (2.0×10(2)-9.5×10(2)ng/L and 23-4.3×10(2)ng/gdw) in 2016, indicating that the BPs levels in Taihu Lake have aggravated recently. In waters, BPAF has become the predominant congener in Taihu Lake, suggesting that BPAF was the most widely used substitute of BPA, recently. In sediments, BPA was the most abundant compound. Moderate or strong correlations between some individual BPs indicated that those BPs may have the common sources and/or similar environmental behavior. The strongly positive correlation between ∑BPs and TOC content indicated that TOC content was one of the major factors controlled the distribution of ∑BPs in the sediment. The risk assessment at the sampling sites showed no high eco-toxicity or estrogenic risk in Taihu Lake."

This study was designed to investigate the relationship between antenatal phenol exposure and birth outcomes in a Chinese obstetric population. Four hundred ninety-six mother-infant pairs recruited from the Laizhou Wan prospective birth cohort in northern China between 2010 and 2013 were included in the study. We measured two phenol metabolites in maternal urine at delivery and examined their associations with birth outcomes including birth weight, crown-heel length, head circumference, gestational age, and ponderal index. Median levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) in urine were 1.07 and 0.50μg/g creatinine, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, a 10-fold increase in BPA levels was associated with a 0.63cm [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25 to 1.01] increase in birth length among boys, but not among girls. No associations were found between TCS levels and any birth outcomes. The positive association of prenatal low-level BPA exposures with anthropometric measures observed among boys, suggests gender differences in the response to antenatal phenol exposure.

One hundred and sixty two women provided three spot urine samples at approximately 11 and 26weeks gestation and at delivery. We applied multivariable linear regression and ridge regression models to estimate the effects of separate and correlated exposures. Multivariable linear regression models revealed that women with short birth-length infants had significantly higher urinary second-trimester NP levels (50th percentile, 5.03μg/g creatinine) (β=-0.47cm; 95% CI=-0.93 to -0.01). Similarly significant relationships were observed between second-trimester mono-methyl phthalate (MMP) exposure and short birth length, second-trimester ΣPAEs and short birth length, second-trimester ΣPAEs exposure and reduced head and chest circumference, second-trimester diethylphosphate (DEP) exposure and reduced birth weight and length, and second-trimester ΣDEPs exposure and short birth length. Women with urinary BPA above the 75th percentile or ΣPAEs levels above the 50th percentile in the third trimester had infants with significantly reduced head circumference. These observations suggest that the second trimester may be the critical stage of susceptibility for fetal development. In ridge regression models, for which women with fewer measures for exposure to NP, BPA, MMP, ΣPAEs, DEP and ΣDEPs simultaneously were available, no relationships were found with infant size at birth.

It exists mainly in natural waters, sediments, and soil, as well as sewage and wastewater sludge. Considering that BPA is a common environmental pollutant that is removed along with chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, and phosphorus in drainage treatment systems, it is important to research the fate of BPA in sewage treatment systems. In this research, laboratory batch experiments on soil degradation and adsorption were conducted with (14)C-BPA, aiming to discuss the transport and degradation characteristics of BPA in both simulated facilities and a soil trench. Based on the experimental results, the Freundlich model could be applied to fit the isothermal adsorption curve of the BPA in soil. A low mobility characteristic of BPA was discovered. The mineralization rate of BPA was fast and that of the reaction showed small fluctuations. After degradation, 21.3 and 17.7% of the BPA groups (the experimental group treated with ammonia oxidase (AMO) inhibitor and the control group) were converted into (14)CO2, respectively. This indicates that the nitrification and degradation of BPA had a certain competitive relationship. Besides, nitrification did not significantly affect the soil residue of BPA. Through the soil trench test, the average removal rate of BPA in the soil trench was 85.5%. (14)CO2 was discharged via the mineralization of BPA, accounting for 2.5% of the initial input. BPA easily accumulated in the bottom soil of the soil trench. BPA and its metabolites in the effluent accounted for 14.5% of the initial dosage.
