## About the project <a name="about"></a>

GarganText is a collaborative web-decentralized-based macro-service platform for the exploration of unstructured texts. It combines tools from natural language processing, text-data-mining bricks, complex networks analysis algorithms and interactive data visualization tools to pave the way toward new kinds of interactions with your textual and digital corpora.

This software is free (as "Libre" in French) software, developed by the CNRS Complex Systems Institute of Paris ÃŽle-de-France (ISC-PIF) and its partners.

GarganText Project: this repo builds the backend for the frontend server built by [backend](https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/haskell-gargantext).


## Installation <a name="install"></a>

Disclaimer: since this project is still in development, this document remains in progress. Please report and improve this documentation if you encounter any issues.

#### Prerequisites

- Install:
  - git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - curl (https://everything.curl.dev/get)
- Clone the project.
  ```shell
  git clone https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/haskell-gargantext.git
  cd haskell-gargantext
  ```
### Installation

This project can be built with either Stack or Cabal. For historical reasons, we generate a `cabal.project` from the `stack.yaml`, and we do not commit the former to the repo, to have a single "source of truth".
However, it's always possible to generate a `cabal.project` thanks to [stack2cabal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stack2cabal).

#### Install Nix 

Gargantext requires [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) to provide system dependencies (for example, C libraries), but its use is limited to that. In order to install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html):

```shell
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

Verify the installation is complete with
```shell
nix-env --version
nix-env (Nix) 2.19.2
```

**Important:** Before building the project with either `stack` or `cabal` you need to be in the correct Nix shell, which will fetch all the required system dependencies. To do so, just type:

```shell
nix-shell
```

This will take a bit of time the first time.

### Build: choose cabal (new) or stack (old)

#### With Cabal (recommanded)

First, into `nix-shell`:
```shell
cabal update
cabal install
```

#### With Stack

Install [Stack (or Haskell Tool Stack)](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/):

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

Verify the installation is complete with
```shell
stack --version
Version 2.9.1
```

NOTE: Default build (with optimizations) requires large amounts of RAM (16GB at least). To avoid heavy compilation times and swapping out your machine, it is recommended to `stack build` with the `--fast` flag, i.e.:

```shell
stack build --fast
```


#### Keeping the cabal.project updated with stack.yaml

(Section for Developers using cabal only)

Once you have a valid version of `cabal`, building requires generating a valid `cabal.project`. This can be done by installing `stack2cabal`:

```shell
cabal v2-install stack2cabal-1.0.14
```

And finally:

```shell
stack2cabal --no-run-hpack -p '2023-06-25'
cabal v2-build
```


Simply run:

```shell
./bin/update-cabal-project
```

## Initialization <a name="init"></a>

#### 1. Docker-compose will configure your database and some NLP bricks (such as CoreNLP):

``` sh
# If docker is not installed:
# curl -sSL https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/haskell-gargantext/raw/dev/devops/docker/docker-install | sh
cd devops/docker
docker compose up
```
Initialization schema should be loaded automatically (from `devops/postgres/schema.sql`).

##### (Optional) If using stack, then install:
``` sh
stack install
```

#### 2. Copy the configuration file:
``` sh
cp gargantext.ini_toModify gargantext.ini
```
> Do not worry, `.gitignore` avoids adding this file to the repository by mistake, then you can change the passwords in gargantext.ini safely.

#### 3. A user have to be created first as instance:
``` sh
~/.local/bin/gargantext-init "gargantext.ini"
```
Now, `user1` is created with password `1resu`

#### 4. Clone FRONTEND repository:

From the Backend root folder (haskell-gargantext):

```shell
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.iscpif.fr:20022/gargantext/purescript-gargantext.git
```
&nbsp;

## Launch & develop GarganText <a name="launch"></a>

>  **Note:** here, the method with Cabal is used as default


From the Backend root folder (haskell-gargantext):

``` shell
./start
# The start script runs following commands:
# - `./bin/install` to update and build the project
# - `docker compose up` to run the Docker for postgresql from devops/docker folder
# - `cabal run gargantext-server -- --ini gargantext.ini --run Prod` to run other services through `nix-shell`
```

For frontend development and compilation, see the [Frontend Readme.md](https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/purescript-gargantext#dev)

### Working on libraries

When a devlopment is needed on libraries (for instance, the HAL crawler in https://gitlab.iscpif.fr/gargantext/crawlers):

1. Ongoing devlopment (on local repo):
   1. In `cabal.project`:
      - add `../hal` to `packages:`
      - turn off (temporarily) the `hal` in `source-repository-package` 
   2. When changes work and tests are OK, commit in repo `hal`
2. When changes are commited / merged:
   1. Get the hash id, and edit `stack.yaml` with the **new commit id**
   2. run `./bin/update-cabal-project`
      - get an error that sha256 don't match, so update the `./bin/update-cabal-project` with new sha256 hash
      - run again `./bin/update-cabal-project` (to make sure it's a fixed point now)

> Note: without `stack.yaml` we would have to only fix `cabal.project` -> `source-repository-package` commit id. Sha256 is there to make sure CI reruns the tests.

## Use Cases <a name="use-cases"></a>

### Multi-User with Graphical User Interface (Server Mode)

``` sh
~/.local/bin/stack --docker exec gargantext-server -- --ini "gargantext.ini" --run Prod
```

Then you can log in with `user1` / `1resu`


### Command Line Mode tools

#### Simple cooccurrences computation and indexation from a list of Ngrams

``` sh
stack --docker exec gargantext-cli -- CorpusFromGarg.csv ListFromGarg.csv Ouput.json
```

### Analyzing the ngrams table repo

We store the repository in directory `repos` in the [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) file format. To decode it to JSON and analyze, say, using [jq](https://shapeshed.com/jq-json/), use the following command:

``` sh
cat repos/repo.cbor.v5 | stack exec gargantext-cbor2json | jq .
```
### Documentation

To build documentation, run:

```sh
stack build --haddock --no-haddock-deps --fast
```

(in `.stack-work/dist/x86_64-linux-nix/Cabal-3.2.1.0/doc/html/gargantext`).

## GraphQL <a name="graphql"></a>

Some introspection information.

Playground is located at http://localhost:8008/gql

### List all GraphQL types in the Playground

```
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### List details about a type in GraphQL

```
{
  __type(name:"User") {
  	fields {
    	name
      description
      type {
        name
      }
  	}
	}
}
```
## PostgreSQL <a name="pgsql"></a>

### Upgrading using Docker

https://www.cloudytuts.com/tutorials/docker/how-to-upgrade-postgresql-in-docker-and-kubernetes/

To upgrade PostgreSQL in Docker containers, for example from 11.x to 14.x, simply run:
```sh
docker exec -it <container-id> pg_dumpall -U gargantua > 11-db.dump
```

Then, shut down the container, replace `image` section in `devops/docker/docker-compose.yaml` with `postgres:14`. Also, it is a good practice to create a new volume, say `garg-pgdata14` and bind the new container to it. If you want to keep the same volume, remember about removing it like so:
```sh
docker-compose rm postgres
docker volume rm docker_garg-pgdata
```

Now, start the container and execute:
```sh
# need to drop the empty DB first, since schema will be created when restoring the dump
docker exec -i <new-container-id> dropdb -U gargantua gargandbV5
# recreate the db, but empty with no schema
docker exec -i <new-container-id> createdb -U gargantua gargandbV5
# now we can restore the dump
docker exec -i <new-container-id> psql -U gargantua -d gargandbV5 < 11-db.dump
```

### Upgrading using 

There is a solution using pgupgrade_cluster but you need to manage the clusters version 14 and 13. Hence here is a simple solution to upgrade.

First save your data:
```
sudo su postgres
pg_dumpall > gargandb.dump
```

Upgrade postgresql:
```
sudo apt install postgresql-server-14 postgresql-client-14
sudo apt remove --purge postgresql-13
```
Restore your data:
```
sudo su postgres
psql < gargandb.dump
```

Maybe you need to restore the gargantua password
```
ALTER ROLE gargantua PASSWORD 'yourPasswordIn_gargantext.ini'
```
Maybe you need to change the port to 5433 for database connection in your gargantext.ini file.
